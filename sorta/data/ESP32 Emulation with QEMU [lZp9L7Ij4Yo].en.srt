00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,829
hello today we're going to be looking at
running the esp32 code

00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839
running the esp32 code
 

5
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,829
running the esp32 code
on an emulator the technology that we

00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
on an emulator the technology that we
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,110
on an emulator the technology that we
use to do this is called qemu or quick

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,350
what's going on behind the scenes we can
go through to the github repository

and if we have a look at this
 

45
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,110

and under this repositories over here we
 

47
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,670
and under this repositories over here we
can search for qemu

48

can search for qemu
 

49
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,349
can search for qemu
and we can see that there is a fork of

and we can see that there is a fork of
 

51
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,830
and we can see that there is a fork of
the original qemu that has especially

espresso vs code extension we have a
 

77
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,109
espresso vs code extension we have a
docker container that we can use so

there's a couple of things you're going
to need firstly just very quickly head

84
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
to need firstly just very quickly head
 

85
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,350
to need firstly just very quickly head
over to my course

86
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
over to my course
 

87
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,789
over to my course
learn esp32.com go to the course and

88
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
learn esp32.com go to the course and
 

89
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,870
learn esp32.com go to the course and
look at the free videos specifically the

90
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
look at the free videos specifically the
 

91
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,789
look at the free videos specifically the
environment setup and go ahead and

92
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
environment setup and go ahead and
 

93
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,109
environment setup and go ahead and
actually install your environment then

94
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
actually install your environment then
 

95
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,069
actually install your environment then
you're gonna have to head over to

96
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
you're gonna have to head over to
 

97
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,429
you're gonna have to head over to
docker

98
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
docker
 

99
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,270
docker
and you're gonna need to go ahead and

100
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
and you're gonna need to go ahead and
 

101
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,590
and you're gonna need to go ahead and
read up and how to actually install

102
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
read up and how to actually install
 

103
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,749
read up and how to actually install
docker on your machine so if i look over

104
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
docker on your machine so if i look over
 

105
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,469
docker on your machine so if i look over
here i'll notice that i have docker

106
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
here i'll notice that i have docker
 

107
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,670
here i'll notice that i have docker
started

108
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
started
 

109
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,630
started
okay

110
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
okay
 

111
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,789
okay
so let's get cracking with this thing

112
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
so let's get cracking with this thing
 

113
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,910
so let's get cracking with this thing
here i have vs code opened a brand new

114
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
here i have vs code opened a brand new
 

115
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,510
here i have vs code opened a brand new
vs code instance and i'm just going to

116
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
vs code instance and i'm just going to
 

117
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,469
vs code instance and i'm just going to
hit f1 and i'm going to say esp-idf new

118
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
hit f1 and i'm going to say esp-idf new
 

119
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,990
hit f1 and i'm going to say esp-idf new
project if you don't see it you can just

120
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
project if you don't see it you can just
 

121
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,390
project if you don't see it you can just
go esp idf

122
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
go esp idf
 

123
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,630
go esp idf
call on new project

124
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
call on new project
 

125
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,030
call on new project
let's go ahead and select that and we'll

126
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
let's go ahead and select that and we'll
 

127
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,430
let's go ahead and select that and we'll
give it a name this is going to be

128
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
give it a name this is going to be
 

129
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,910
give it a name this is going to be
qemu

130
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920

00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
the esp-idf and i'm going to go ahead
 

151
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,630
the esp-idf and i'm going to go ahead
and say sample project and create

152
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
and say sample project and create
 

153
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,670
and say sample project and create
project and it's going to ask me

154
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
project and it's going to ask me
 

155
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,869
project and it's going to ask me
this has been created do you want to

156
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
this has been created do you want to
 

157

so here i have a brand new project
 

165
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,350
so here i have a brand new project
notice that we've got this dev container

166
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
notice that we've got this dev container
 

167
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,350
notice that we've got this dev container
over here that is the docker file that

168
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
over here that is the docker file that
 

169
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,630
over here that is the docker file that
we need in order to run our qmu instance

170
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
we need in order to run our qmu instance
 

171
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,470
we need in order to run our qmu instance
but for now what i'm going to be doing

172
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
but for now what i'm going to be doing
 

173
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,670
but for now what i'm going to be doing
is i'm just going to be writing a little

174
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
is i'm just going to be writing a little
 

175
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,830
is i'm just going to be writing a little
bit of code okay and the question is do

176
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
bit of code okay and the question is do
 

177
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,750
bit of code okay and the question is do
we have some intellisense so let's have

178
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
we have some intellisense so let's have
 

179
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,790
we have some intellisense so let's have
a look so hash include

180
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
a look so hash include
 

181
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,630
a look so hash include
esp underscore log dot h

182
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
esp underscore log dot h
 

183
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,509
esp underscore log dot h
the pso that's great so

184
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
the pso that's great so
 

185
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,710
the pso that's great so
so let's go ahead here and create a

186
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
so let's go ahead here and create a
 

187
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,229
so let's go ahead here and create a
while loop

188
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
while loop
 

189
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,270
while loop
so while true

190
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280

 

191
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,869

so let's go ahead and print out a log

192
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
so let's go ahead and print out a log
 

193
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,470
so let's go ahead and print out a log
we'll say

194
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
we'll say
 

195
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,630
we'll say
esp underscore

196
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
esp underscore
 

197
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,750
esp underscore
log

198
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
log
 

199
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,949
log
i

200
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
i
 

201
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,710
i
for log informational

202
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
for log informational
 

203
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,630
for log informational
and we have the option the first thing

204
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
and we have the option the first thing
 

205
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,789
and we have the option the first thing
tells me that we can put a tag in there

206
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
tells me that we can put a tag in there
 

207
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,869
tells me that we can put a tag in there
so we'll just uh put something like qemu

208
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
so we'll just uh put something like qemu
 

209
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,550
so we'll just uh put something like qemu
in there and then essentially we can put

210
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
in there and then essentially we can put
 

211
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,710
in there and then essentially we can put
in some sort of message we say running

212
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
in some sort of message we say running
 

213
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,110
in some sort of message we say running
q emu

214
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
q emu
 

215
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,390
q emu
count

216
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
count
 

217
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,070
count
percent d

218
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
percent d
 

219
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,990
percent d
we haven't got something there just yet

220
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
we haven't got something there just yet
 

221
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,589
we haven't got something there just yet
so let's go ahead and create something

222
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
so let's go ahead and create something
 

223
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,110
so let's go ahead and create something
there

224
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
there
 

225
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,589
there
we'll see over here into count

226
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
we'll see over here into count
 

227
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,550
we'll see over here into count
is equal to zero

228
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
is equal to zero
 

229
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,270
is equal to zero
over here we'll basically say count

230
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
over here we'll basically say count
 

231
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,550
over here we'll basically say count
plus plus

232
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560

 

233
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,710

then i'd like to add in a short delay so

234
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
then i'd like to add in a short delay so
 

235
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,070
then i'd like to add in a short delay so
to do that i'll need to add the free

236
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
to do that i'll need to add the free
 

237
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,469
to do that i'll need to add the free
rtos libraries

238
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
rtos libraries
 

239
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,950
rtos libraries
hashing code free r toss

249
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,150

then over here

250
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
then over here
 

251
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,469
then over here
we can say the task delay

252
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
we can say the task delay
 

253
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,790
we can say the task delay
and then we can use the macropdms2tx

254
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800

 

255
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,230

and over here we can put in the miller

256
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
and over here we can put in the miller
 

257
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,909
and over here we can put in the miller
seconds we want to delay i'll just put

258
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
seconds we want to delay i'll just put
 

259
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,710
seconds we want to delay i'll just put
in 1000.

260
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
in 1000.
 

261
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,830
in 1000.
okay so that is our code written done

262
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
okay so that is our code written done
 

263
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,670
okay so that is our code written done
now before we even try to compile this

264
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
now before we even try to compile this
 

265
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,029
now before we even try to compile this
thing what i'd like to do is actually

266
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
thing what i'd like to do is actually
 

267
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,909
thing what i'd like to do is actually
open it up in my docker container as you

268
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
open it up in my docker container as you
 

269
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,390
open it up in my docker container as you
know it is as it does have this doc this

270
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
know it is as it does have this doc this
 

271
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,749
know it is as it does have this doc this
dev container so what i'm going to do is

272
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
dev container so what i'm going to do is
 

273
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,590
dev container so what i'm going to do is
i'm going to hit f1 and i'm going to say

274
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
i'm going to hit f1 and i'm going to say
 

275
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,310
i'm going to hit f1 and i'm going to say
open in remote location so remote

276
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
open in remote location so remote
 

277
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,070
open in remote location so remote
container reopening container that's

278
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
container reopening container that's
 

279
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,510
container reopening container that's
what i want so make sure everything's

280
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
what i want so make sure everything's
 

281
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,270
what i want so make sure everything's
saved and let's go ahead and do that and

282
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
saved and let's go ahead and do that and
 

283
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,629
saved and let's go ahead and do that and
we can see that it's starting the dev

284
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
we can see that it's starting the dev
 

285
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,310
we can see that it's starting the dev
container

286
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
container
 

287
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,390
container
all right so it looks like it's now

288
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
all right so it looks like it's now
 

289
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,469
all right so it looks like it's now
started up which is great so let's go

290
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
started up which is great so let's go
 

291
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,550
started up which is great so let's go
ahead and open up our main again and we

292
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
ahead and open up our main again and we
 

293
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,790
ahead and open up our main again and we
can see our code that we've just written

294
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
can see our code that we've just written
 

295
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,870
can see our code that we've just written
and at this point we can go ahead and

296
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
and at this point we can go ahead and
 

297
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,710
and at this point we can go ahead and
build it that's the first thing that we

298
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
build it that's the first thing that we
 

299
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,629
build it that's the first thing that we
will need to do for running it in an

300
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
will need to do for running it in an
 

301
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,550
will need to do for running it in an
emulator is actually build it

302
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
emulator is actually build it
 

303
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,390
emulator is actually build it
so over here you can see that you can

304
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
so over here you can see that you can
 

305
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,790
so over here you can see that you can
just press that esp-idf build that's one

306
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
just press that esp-idf build that's one
 

307
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,070
just press that esp-idf build that's one
way to do it

308
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
way to do it
 

309
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,390
way to do it
my preference is to actually open up a

310
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
my preference is to actually open up a
 

311
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,310
my preference is to actually open up a
terminal and then write the commands

312
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
terminal and then write the commands
 

313
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,469
terminal and then write the commands
which is idf dot py

314
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
which is idf dot py
 

315
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,629
which is idf dot py
build

316
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
build
 

317
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,790
build
and uh as this is the first time it's

318
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
and uh as this is the first time it's
 

319
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,629
and uh as this is the first time it's
actually building this it might take a

320
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
actually building this it might take a
 

321
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,350
actually building this it might take a
minute or two

322
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
minute or two
 

323
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,029
minute or two
okay so it has now built successfully

324
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
okay so it has now built successfully
 

325
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,550
okay so it has now built successfully
you might notice that the intellisense

326
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
you might notice that the intellisense
 

327
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,629
you might notice that the intellisense
have got has gone a bit wonky

328
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
have got has gone a bit wonky
 

329
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,710
have got has gone a bit wonky
um if we have a look at what's happening

330
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
um if we have a look at what's happening
 

331
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,909
um if we have a look at what's happening
inside our vs code file we'll notice

332
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
inside our vs code file we'll notice
 

333
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,670
inside our vs code file we'll notice
that the c plus plus properties is all

334
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
that the c plus plus properties is all
 

335
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,830
that the c plus plus properties is all
pointing to my c drive and obviously my

336
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
pointing to my c drive and obviously my
 

337
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,510
pointing to my c drive and obviously my
docker container doesn't know where my c

338
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
docker container doesn't know where my c
 

339
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,590
docker container doesn't know where my c
drive is so if you wanted to fix that

340
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
drive is so if you wanted to fix that
 

341
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,150
drive is so if you wanted to fix that
you could go ahead and actually find

342
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
you could go ahead and actually find
 

343
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,270
you could go ahead and actually find
where the

344
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
where the
 

345
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,230
where the
gcc extension or gcc

346
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
gcc extension or gcc
 

347
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,070
gcc extension or gcc
compiler is and essentially add that

348
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
compiler is and essentially add that
 

349
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,469
compiler is and essentially add that
here and then go through to the settings

350
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
here and then go through to the settings
 

351
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,230
here and then go through to the settings
and change all these parts

352
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
and change all these parts
 

353
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,510
and change all these parts
correctly but that's not the point of

354
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
correctly but that's not the point of
 

355
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,950
correctly but that's not the point of
what we're trying to do here so let's

356
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
what we're trying to do here so let's
 

357
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,870
what we're trying to do here so let's
not worry about that too much right now

358
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
not worry about that too much right now
 

359
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,150
not worry about that too much right now
uh what i am going to do is i'm going to

360
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
uh what i am going to do is i'm going to
 

361
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,230
uh what i am going to do is i'm going to
create a new file here let's put it on

362
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
create a new file here let's put it on
 

363
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,749
create a new file here let's put it on
the root and i'm just going to call this

364
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
the root and i'm just going to call this
 

365
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,510
the root and i'm just going to call this
commands

366
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
commands
 

367
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,670
commands
and i'll just make it a text file

368
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
and i'll just make it a text file
 

369
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,390
and i'll just make it a text file
so

370
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
so
 

371
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,629
so
i'm just going to put the commands that

372
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
i'm just going to put the commands that
 

373
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,629
i'm just going to put the commands that
i'm going to be running inside here just

374
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
i'm going to be running inside here just
 

375
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,230
i'm going to be running inside here just
so that we can actually see what we need

376
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
so that we can actually see what we need
 

377
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,150
so that we can actually see what we need
to do so the very first step of actually

378
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
to do so the very first step of actually
 

379
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,870
to do so the very first step of actually
getting qemu up and running is we need

380
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
getting qemu up and running is we need
 

381
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,430
getting qemu up and running is we need
to actually combine all our bin files if

382
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
to actually combine all our bin files if
 

383
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,629
to actually combine all our bin files if
we have a look at the build folder we'll

384
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
we have a look at the build folder we'll
 

385
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,469
we have a look at the build folder we'll
notice that there's actually a couple of

386
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
notice that there's actually a couple of
 

387
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,589
notice that there's actually a couple of
different bin files the primary being

388
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
different bin files the primary being
 

389
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,749
different bin files the primary being
this one over here qme test one bin

390
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
this one over here qme test one bin
 

391
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,950
this one over here qme test one bin
that's the bin file that was just

392
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
that's the bin file that was just
 

393
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,029
that's the bin file that was just
generated by building this project

394
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
generated by building this project
 

395
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,110
generated by building this project
however if we have a look at the

396
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
however if we have a look at the
 

397
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,309
however if we have a look at the
flasherogs.json

398
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319

 

399
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,909

we'll notice actually at this point in

400
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
we'll notice actually at this point in
 

401
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,830
we'll notice actually at this point in
time there's actually three

402
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
time there's actually three
 

403
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,589
time there's actually three
bin files and it'll actually tell us

404
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
bin files and it'll actually tell us
 

405
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,189
bin files and it'll actually tell us
where they are

406
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
where they are
 

407
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,670
where they are
there's the partition table boom there

408
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
there's the partition table boom there
 

409
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,430
there's the partition table boom there
is the bootloader bin

410
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
is the bootloader bin
 

411
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,830
is the bootloader bin
and then there's this one over here

412
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
and then there's this one over here
 

413
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,390
and then there's this one over here
also interestingly is notice the offset

414
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
also interestingly is notice the offset
 

415
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,990
also interestingly is notice the offset
of where they are this is essentially

416
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
of where they are this is essentially
 

417
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,029
of where they are this is essentially
where they would

418
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
where they would
 

419
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,510
where they would
be written to within the actual flash so

420
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
be written to within the actual flash so
 

421
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,790
be written to within the actual flash so
what we need to do is we need to

422
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
what we need to do is we need to
 

423
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,430
what we need to do is we need to
actually create a single file that

424
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
actually create a single file that
 

425
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,189
actually create a single file that
represents what our flash is going to

426
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
represents what our flash is going to
 

427
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,189
represents what our flash is going to
look just to uh be clear as to what it

428
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
look just to uh be clear as to what it
 

429
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,790
look just to uh be clear as to what it
is that we're trying to do what we'll

430
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
is that we're trying to do what we'll
 

431
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,270
is that we're trying to do what we'll
need to do is we need to create a file

432
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
need to do is we need to create a file
 

433
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,749
need to do is we need to create a file
and this file will need to be four

434
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
and this file will need to be four
 

435
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,510
and this file will need to be four
megabytes large because that is the size

436
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
megabytes large because that is the size
 

437
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,230
megabytes large because that is the size
of my flash then starting at about 1000

438
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
of my flash then starting at about 1000
 

439
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,150
of my flash then starting at about 1000
wherever that is over here we'll need to

440
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
wherever that is over here we'll need to
 

441
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,230
wherever that is over here we'll need to
basically start writing in the

442
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
basically start writing in the
 

443
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,350
basically start writing in the
bootloader

444
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360

 

445
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,150

and that's going to happen at

446
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
and that's going to happen at
 

447
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,189
and that's going to happen at
and that's going to happen at 0x1000

448
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
and that's going to happen at 0x1000
 

449
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,350
and that's going to happen at 0x1000
of this file then a little bit later we

450
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
of this file then a little bit later we
 

451
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,029
of this file then a little bit later we
need to write

452
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
need to write
 

453
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,710
need to write
the partition table

454
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720

 

455
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,469

at 0x

456
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
at 0x
 

457
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,230
at 0x
8000 i believe it is

458
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
8000 i believe it is
 

459
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,189
8000 i believe it is
and then a little bit later at 10 000 we

460
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
and then a little bit later at 10 000 we
 

461
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,350
and then a little bit later at 10 000 we
need to write our app

462
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360

 

463
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,750

so we can go ahead and actually get some

464
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
so we can go ahead and actually get some
 

465
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,310
so we can go ahead and actually get some
python 2 or some javascript to actually

466
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
python 2 or some javascript to actually
 

467
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,990
python 2 or some javascript to actually
put together a file like that for us

468
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
put together a file like that for us
 

469
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,670
put together a file like that for us
luckily we don't need to do that there's

470
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
luckily we don't need to do that there's
 

471
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,990
luckily we don't need to do that there's
actually a command that will do it for

472
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
actually a command that will do it for
 

473
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,670
actually a command that will do it for
us and what i'll do is i'll just go

474
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
us and what i'll do is i'll just go
 

475
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,870
us and what i'll do is i'll just go
ahead and paste this in here and then

476
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
ahead and paste this in here and then
 

477
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,630
ahead and paste this in here and then
we'll walk through what it actually does

478
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
we'll walk through what it actually does
 

479
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,949
we'll walk through what it actually does
so what this is doing is it's basically

480
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
so what this is doing is it's basically
 

481
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,590
so what this is doing is it's basically
launching this

482
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:52,600
launching this
 

483
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,670
launching this
esptool.py which is essentially a

484
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
esptool.py which is essentially a
 

485
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,870
esptool.py which is essentially a
very common tool that we use with the

486
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
very common tool that we use with the
 

487
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,230
very common tool that we use with the
chip and you'll notice it's forward

488
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
chip and you'll notice it's forward
 

489
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,150
chip and you'll notice it's forward
slash dot forward slash which basically

490
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
slash dot forward slash which basically
 

491
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,070
slash dot forward slash which basically
means i want to execute this thing and

492
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
means i want to execute this thing and
 

493
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,750
means i want to execute this thing and
over here we basically specify which

494
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
over here we basically specify which
 

495
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,230
over here we basically specify which
chip is we want the esp32 but it could

496
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
chip is we want the esp32 but it could
 

497
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,630
chip is we want the esp32 but it could
also be the s2 or the c3 or whatever it

498
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
also be the s2 or the c3 or whatever it
 

499
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,870
also be the s2 or the c3 or whatever it
is then we've got this command called

500
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
is then we've got this command called
 

501
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,630
is then we've got this command called
merge bin which is what we want to do we

502
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
merge bin which is what we want to do we
 

503
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,070
merge bin which is what we want to do we
want to merge all these bin files

504
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
want to merge all these bin files
 

505
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,310
want to merge all these bin files
together um the output will be

506
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
together um the output will be
 

507
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,150
together um the output will be
results.bin that's essentially the new

508
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
results.bin that's essentially the new
 

509
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,829
results.bin that's essentially the new
bin file that it's going to create with

510
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
bin file that it's going to create with
 

511
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,910
bin file that it's going to create with
all the mergers all right full flash

512
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
all the mergers all right full flash
 

513
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,910
all the mergers all right full flash
size is gonna be four megabytes because

514
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
size is gonna be four megabytes because
 

515
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,230
size is gonna be four megabytes because
that's how big my flash is then starting

516
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
that's how big my flash is then starting
 

517
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,110
that's how big my flash is then starting
at 1000 hex we're gonna go ahead and get

518
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
at 1000 hex we're gonna go ahead and get
 

519
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,670
at 1000 hex we're gonna go ahead and get
the bolt bootloader bootloader bin which

520
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
the bolt bootloader bootloader bin which
 

521
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,310
the bolt bootloader bootloader bin which
is build bootloader

522
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
is build bootloader
 

523
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,710
is build bootloader
bootloader bin over there then starting

524
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
bootloader bin over there then starting
 

525
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,470
bootloader bin over there then starting
at 8 000 we're gonna go build partition

526
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
at 8 000 we're gonna go build partition
 

527
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,470
at 8 000 we're gonna go build partition
table partition table the bin partition

528
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
table partition table the bin partition
 

529
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,550
table partition table the bin partition
table partition table type bin and then

530
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
table partition table type bin and then
 

531
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,870
table partition table type bin and then
finally at ten thousand we're going to

532
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
finally at ten thousand we're going to
 

533
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,949
finally at ten thousand we're going to
go to build commute test two which is

534
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
go to build commute test two which is
 

535
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,590
go to build commute test two which is
essentially on here except for it's not

536
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
essentially on here except for it's not
 

537
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,590
essentially on here except for it's not
queuing test two qme

538
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
queuing test two qme
 

539
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,630
queuing test two qme
test dash one

540
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
test dash one
 

541
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,190
test dash one
qme test dash one bin yep that looks

542
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
qme test dash one bin yep that looks
 

543
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,389
qme test dash one bin yep that looks
good and then flash mode dio and then

544
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
good and then flash mode dio and then
 

545
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,110
good and then flash mode dio and then
flash frequency and flash size so if we

546
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
flash frequency and flash size so if we
 

547
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,630
flash frequency and flash size so if we
go ahead and

548
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
go ahead and
 

549
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,310
go ahead and
put that in here

550
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
put that in here
 

551
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,710
put that in here
and i press enter it says that it's

552
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
and i press enter it says that it's
 

553
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,630
and i press enter it says that it's
written it so let's go to the root of

554
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
written it so let's go to the root of
 

555
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,150
written it so let's go to the root of
the project and we'll notice over here

556
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
the project and we'll notice over here
 

557
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,069
the project and we'll notice over here
i've got this resulted bin so that's my

558
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
i've got this resulted bin so that's my
 

559
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,269
i've got this resulted bin so that's my
combined bin file

560
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
combined bin file
 

561
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,030
combined bin file
okay cool so that's the first thing we

562
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
okay cool so that's the first thing we
 

563
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,870
okay cool so that's the first thing we
needed to do the next thing we needed to

564
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
needed to do the next thing we needed to
 

565
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,910
needed to do the next thing we needed to
do is we need to basically run qemu

566
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
do is we need to basically run qemu
 

567
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,670
do is we need to basically run qemu
and to do that we're just basically

568
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
and to do that we're just basically
 

569
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,150
and to do that we're just basically
going to look at this command over here

570
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
going to look at this command over here
 

571
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,150
going to look at this command over here
so we're going to run qemu system

572
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
so we're going to run qemu system
 

573
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,949
so we're going to run qemu system
extension so this particular executable

574
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
extension so this particular executable
 

575
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,310
extension so this particular executable
is actually

576
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
is actually
 

577
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,310
is actually
recognized by this environment so

578
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
recognized by this environment so
 

579
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,150
recognized by this environment so
there's actually this is part of my

580
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
there's actually this is part of my
 

581
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,310
there's actually this is part of my
environment variables already so i don't

582
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
environment variables already so i don't
 

583
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,389
environment variables already so i don't
need to go ahead and look for it it's

584
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
need to go ahead and look for it it's
 

585
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,990
need to go ahead and look for it it's
already there which is quite nice

586
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
already there which is quite nice
 

587
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,069
already there which is quite nice
because of this docker the way because

588
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
because of this docker the way because
 

589
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,509
because of this docker the way because
of the way this docker container has

590
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
of the way this docker container has
 

591
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,509
of the way this docker container has
been set up right uh we're going to run

592
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
been set up right uh we're going to run
 

593
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,030
been set up right uh we're going to run
no graphic machine is esp32 the drive is

594
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
no graphic machine is esp32 the drive is
 

595
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,949
no graphic machine is esp32 the drive is
going to be this result.bin which is

596
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
going to be this result.bin which is
 

597
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,870
going to be this result.bin which is
essentially what we generated over here

598
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
essentially what we generated over here
 

599
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,470
essentially what we generated over here
and there's some sort of other options

600
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
and there's some sort of other options
 

601
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,230
and there's some sort of other options
as to how it should actually recognize

602
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
as to how it should actually recognize
 

603
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,590
as to how it should actually recognize
this particular flash file so i'm just

604
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
this particular flash file so i'm just
 

605
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,870
this particular flash file so i'm just
going to copy that

606
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
going to copy that
 

607
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,949
going to copy that
and i'm going to paste this in here and

608
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
and i'm going to paste this in here and
 

609
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,110
and i'm going to paste this in here and
if we did it right we can see yeah it's

610
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
if we did it right we can see yeah it's
 

611
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,990
if we did it right we can see yeah it's
starting and we can see i'll count one

612
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
starting and we can see i'll count one
 

613
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,110
starting and we can see i'll count one
two three and so on okay interestingly i

614
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
two three and so on okay interestingly i
 

615
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,550
two three and so on okay interestingly i
find it very hot i don't know how to

616
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
find it very hot i don't know how to
 

617
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,389
find it very hot i don't know how to
basically exit out of this so i'm just

618
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
basically exit out of this so i'm just
 

619
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,990
basically exit out of this so i'm just
going to go ahead and kill it and

620
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
going to go ahead and kill it and
 

621
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,509
going to go ahead and kill it and
there's essentially two more options

622
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
there's essentially two more options
 

623
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,389
there's essentially two more options
that are of interest to us the minus s

624
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
that are of interest to us the minus s
 

625
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,110
that are of interest to us the minus s
lower case we'll put it into debug mode

626
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
lower case we'll put it into debug mode
 

627
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,430
lower case we'll put it into debug mode
so that we can actually debug it and

628
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
so that we can actually debug it and
 

629
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,509
so that we can actually debug it and
minus capital s means

630
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
minus capital s means
 

631
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,990
minus capital s means
hold the execution don't start it until

632
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
hold the execution don't start it until
 

633
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,550
hold the execution don't start it until
you actually have a breakpoint on there

634
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
you actually have a breakpoint on there
 

635
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,790
you actually have a breakpoint on there
so let's go ahead and run this one now

636
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
so let's go ahead and run this one now
 

637
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,550
so let's go ahead and run this one now
so i'll just go ahead and create a new

638
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
so i'll just go ahead and create a new
 

639
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,470
so i'll just go ahead and create a new
instance for a new shell

640
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
instance for a new shell
 

641
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,790
instance for a new shell

695
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,190
and we're going to be modifying this a
bit so you'll notice over here that

additional stuff the thing that we need
 

701
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,030
additional stuff the thing that we need
to do is actually get the gdb path

702
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
to do is actually get the gdb path
 

703
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,910
to do is actually get the gdb path
and

704

and actually open up a new terminal and
 

711
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,069
and actually open up a new terminal and
we'll just go ahead and find it quickly

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,829
so with that let's go ahead and make
sure we've got the attach to qmu

800
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
sure we've got the attach to qmu
 

801
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,030
sure we've got the attach to qmu
selected and let's go ahead and press

802
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
selected and let's go ahead and press
 

803
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,990
selected and let's go ahead and press
the play button

804
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000

 

805
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,750

and we can see that we're hitting a

806
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
and we can see that we're hitting a
 

807
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,590
and we can see that we're hitting a
breakpoint and essentially we can f10

808
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
breakpoint and essentially we can f10
 

809
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,030
breakpoint and essentially we can f10
through that and we can mouse over the

810
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
through that and we can mouse over the
 

811
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,949
through that and we can mouse over the
count we can play and it'll come back

812
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
count we can play and it'll come back
 

813
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,710
count we can play and it'll come back
and we can go to our terminal and we can

814
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
and we can go to our terminal and we can
 

815
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,389
and we can go to our terminal and we can
still see the output over there and we

816
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
still see the output over there and we
 

817
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,990
still see the output over there and we
can see the local variables over here

818
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
can see the local variables over here
 

819
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,269
can see the local variables over here
and a little bit of the stack trace over

820
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
and a little bit of the stack trace over
 

821
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,150
and a little bit of the stack trace over
here step over all right and that's it

822
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
here step over all right and that's it
 

823
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,750
here step over all right and that's it
so now we've seen how to set up qemu

824
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
so now we've seen how to set up qemu
 

825
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,670
so now we've seen how to set up qemu
with the breakpoint and run some esp32

826
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
with the breakpoint and run some esp32
 

827
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,030
with the breakpoint and run some esp32
