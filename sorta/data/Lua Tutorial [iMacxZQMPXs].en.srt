21
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,990
okay so first thing you're going to want
to do is install Lua so you can either

22
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
to do is install Lua so you can either
 

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,070
to do is install Lua so you can either
install these binary files here you can

24
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
install these binary files here you can
 

25
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,509
install these binary files here you can
just go to lu- us.org

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,240
swiki slab binaries like like that or if
 

29
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,270
swiki slab binaries like like that or if
you're on Windows you could go to

30
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:34,280
you're on Windows you could go to
 

31
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,510
you're on Windows you could go to
code.google.com/ P Lua for Windows you

32
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
code.google.com/ P Lua for Windows you
 

33
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,869
code.google.com/ P Lua for Windows you
can use either one of those I am on OSX

34
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
can use either one of those I am on OSX
 

35
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,310

doesn't really matter everything here is

36
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
doesn't really matter everything here is
 

37
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,270
doesn't really matter everything here is
going to be exactly the same no matter

38
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:44,280
going to be exactly the same no matter
 

39
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,950
going to be exactly the same no matter
what operating system you're on but you

00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:45,960
what operating system you're on but you
 

41
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,470
what operating system you're on but you
can see right here is everything you're

42
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:47,480
can see right here is everything you're
 

43
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,869
can see right here is everything you're
going to need to install and you should

44
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
going to need to install and you should
 

45
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,549
going to need to install and you should
have no problem with that so let's start

46
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
have no problem with that so let's start
 

47
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,110
have no problem with that so let's start
writing some code okay so on the left

48
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
writing some code okay so on the left
 

49
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,830
writing some code okay so on the left
side of the screen I have where I'm

50
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:54,840
side of the screen I have where I'm
 

51
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,510
side of the screen I have where I'm
going to be inputting all the code basic

52
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:56,520
going to be inputting all the code basic
 

53
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,709
going to be inputting all the code basic
text editor Sublime on the right side I

54
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
text editor Sublime on the right side I
 

55
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,229
text editor Sublime on the right side I
have my terminal and if you are on

56
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:01,239
have my terminal and if you are on
 

57
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:03,590
have my terminal and if you are on
Windows this would be your command line

58
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
Windows this would be your command line
 

59
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,710
Windows this would be your command line
so let's just jump right in here and

60
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:05,720
so let's just jump right in here and
 

61
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,950
so let's just jump right in here and
you're going to have the extension of

62
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:07,960
you're going to have the extension of
 

63
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,870
you're going to have the extension of
Lua for all of your files and this is

64
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:09,880
Lua for all of your files and this is
 

65
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,990
Lua for all of your files and this is
just lu. Lua right like that and let's

66
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,000
just lu. Lua right like that and let's
 

67
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,990
just lu. Lua right like that and let's
do a Hello World so we're going to say

68
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
do a Hello World so we're going to say
 

69
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,149
do a Hello World so we're going to say
print hello world just that simple save

70
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
print hello world just that simple save
 

71
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,789
print hello world just that simple save
that jump over here and this is how

72
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:19,799
that jump over here and this is how
 

73
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,749
that jump over here and this is how
we're going to execute our programs just

74
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
we're going to execute our programs just
 

75
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,510
we're going to execute our programs just
Lua and then the name of your Lua file

76
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,520
Lua and then the name of your Lua file
 

77
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,749
Lua and then the name of your Lua file
and boom hello world so hello world is

78
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:26,759
and boom hello world so hello world is
 

79
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,270
and boom hello world so hello world is
out of the way that is how you would

80
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,280
out of the way that is how you would
 

81
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,030
out of the way that is how you would
print to the terminal now your you're

82
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,040
print to the terminal now your you're
 

83
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,109
print to the terminal now your you're
going to be able to make comments just

84
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:32,119
going to be able to make comments just
 

85
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,870
going to be able to make comments just
like this or you can make multi-line

86
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
like this or you can make multi-line
 

87
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,389
like this or you can make multi-line
comments like this you can see how they

88
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:37,399
comments like this you can see how they
 

89
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,469
comments like this you can see how they
popped up right there so multi line and

90
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
popped up right there so multi line and
 

91
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,469
popped up right there so multi line and
there we go comments are out of the way

92
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
there we go comments are out of the way
 

93
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,310
there we go comments are out of the way
now your variable names can't start with

94
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
now your variable names can't start with
 

95
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,149
now your variable names can't start with
a number but they are going to be able

96
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
a number but they are going to be able
 

97
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,429
a number but they are going to be able
to contain letters numbers and

98
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:48,439
to contain letters numbers and
 

99
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,230
to contain letters numbers and
underscore and we just create one right

100
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,240
underscore and we just create one right
 

101
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,469
underscore and we just create one right
like this basically Lua is going to

102
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:53,479
like this basically Lua is going to
 

103
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,910
like this basically Lua is going to
dynamically type based off of whatever

104
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
dynamically type based off of whatever
 

105
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,190
dynamically type based off of whatever
you save in this variable so this

106
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,200
you save in this variable so this
 

107
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,550
you save in this variable so this
automatically becomes a string because

108
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
automatically becomes a string because
 

109
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,510
automatically becomes a string because
this is a string right here and your

110
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
this is a string right here and your
 

111
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,350
this is a string right here and your
strings of course can either be double

112
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:04,360
strings of course can either be double
 

113
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,469
strings of course can either be double
quotes or you could have them be single

114
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
quotes or you could have them be single
 

115
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,389
quotes or you could have them be single
quotes doesn't really matter another way

116
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
quotes doesn't really matter another way
 

117
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,389
quotes doesn't really matter another way
for you to be able to print stuff out in

118
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
for you to be able to print stuff out in
 

119
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,110
for you to be able to print stuff out in
Lua is to go IO write like this and you

120
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,120
Lua is to go IO write like this and you
 

121
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,350
Lua is to go IO write like this and you
could say something like size of string

122
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
could say something like size of string
 

123
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,869
could say something like size of string
and then you could separate that if you

124
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
and then you could separate that if you
 

125
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,869
and then you could separate that if you
wanted to put the string inside of here

126
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
wanted to put the string inside of here
 

127
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,470
wanted to put the string inside of here
and on top of that let's say that we

128
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
and on top of that let's say that we
 

129
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,470
and on top of that let's say that we
also want to get the size or number of

130
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
also want to get the size or number of
 

131
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,990
also want to get the size or number of
characters in our string we would just

132
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
characters in our string we would just
 

133
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,229
characters in our string we would just
put a number sign and name in this

134
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
put a number sign and name in this
 

135
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,949
put a number sign and name in this
situation and then there's going to be a

136
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:29,959
situation and then there's going to be a
 

137
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,190
situation and then there's going to be a
bunch of things you can backslash this

138
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,200
bunch of things you can backslash this
 

139
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,790
bunch of things you can backslash this
is going to be a new line like this it's

140
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
is going to be a new line like this it's
 

141
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,750
is going to be a new line like this it's
just a short easy way for us to be able

142
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:36,760
just a short easy way for us to be able
 

143
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,229
just a short easy way for us to be able
to throw a new line in here which is

144
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
to throw a new line in here which is
 

145
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,910
to throw a new line in here which is
just going to skip us to the next line

146
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
just going to skip us to the next line
 

147
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,309
just going to skip us to the next line
and there's a couple other little

148
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:41,319
and there's a couple other little
 

149
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,030
and there's a couple other little
backslashes you can use there's a new

150
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
backslashes you can use there's a new
 

151
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,149
backslashes you can use there's a new
line of course you can also do a

152
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:45,159
line of course you can also do a
 

153
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,070
line of course you can also do a
backspace you could do a tab of course

154
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
backspace you could do a tab of course
 

155
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,509
backspace you could do a tab of course
you're going to need a way to be able to

156
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
you're going to need a way to be able to
 

157
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,430
you're going to need a way to be able to
print a backs slash inside of something

158
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
print a backs slash inside of something
 

159
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,430
print a backs slash inside of something
like IO right you're also going to be

160
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
like IO right you're also going to be
 

161
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,949
like IO right you're also going to be
able to print quotes double quotes like

162
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:55,959
able to print quotes double quotes like
 

163
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,390
able to print quotes double quotes like
this and also single quotes and those

164
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
this and also single quotes and those
 

165
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,190
this and also single quotes and those
would be used in situations of in which

166
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,200
would be used in situations of in which
 

167
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,630
would be used in situations of in which
you have double quotes here but you want

168
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:01,640
you have double quotes here but you want
 

169
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,350
you have double quotes here but you want
to put a double quote let's say right

170
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
to put a double quote let's say right
 

171
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,270
to put a double quote let's say right
here that would allow you to do that and

172
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
here that would allow you to do that and
 

173
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,990
here that would allow you to do that and
we need to do this because otherwise it

174
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,000
we need to do this because otherwise it
 

175
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,110
we need to do this because otherwise it
would not know where the string ended

176
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
would not know where the string ended
 

177
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,990
would not know where the string ended
and if we file save that execute it you

178
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,000
and if we file save that execute it you
 

179
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,949
and if we file save that execute it you
can see size of string is five it

180
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
can see size of string is five it
 

181
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,670
can see size of string is five it
automatically prints out for you now an

182
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,680
automatically prints out for you now an
 

183
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,710
automatically prints out for you now an
interesting thing here is even though

184
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
interesting thing here is even though
 

185
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,949
interesting thing here is even though
this is defined as a string currently we

186
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
this is defined as a string currently we
 

187
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,949
this is defined as a string currently we
can just as easily come in here and go

188
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
can just as easily come in here and go
 

189
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,270
can just as easily come in here and go
name is equal to four like that and that

190
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,280
name is equal to four like that and that
 

191
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,949
name is equal to four like that and that
is not an error so you'll be able to

192
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:25,959
is not an error so you'll be able to
 

193
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,869
is not an error so you'll be able to
start off as a string and then convert

194
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:27,879
start off as a string and then convert
 

195
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,630
start off as a string and then convert
the data or the variable over into an

196
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
the data or the variable over into an
 

197
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,309
the data or the variable over into an
integer we could then come in here and

198
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
integer we could then come in here and
 

199
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,949
integer we could then come in here and
say something like my name is and name

200
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:35,959
say something like my name is and name
 

201
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,789
say something like my name is and name
like that and you can see my name is for

202
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:37,799
like that and you can see my name is for
 

203
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,309
like that and you can see my name is for
comes out there no errors are thrown

204
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:39,319
comes out there no errors are thrown
 

205
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,869
comes out there no errors are thrown
other programming languages would throw

206
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
other programming languages would throw
 

207
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,670
other programming languages would throw
errors however now Lua only has floating

208
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
errors however now Lua only has floating

Point numbers or what they call just

210
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:45,400
Point numbers or what they call just
 

211
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,670
Point numbers or what they call just
simple numbers and the biggest integer

212
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:48,680
simple numbers and the biggest integer
 

213
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,910
simple numbers and the biggest integer
that you could store inside of Lua is

214
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:50,920
that you could store inside of Lua is
 

215
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,429
that you could store inside of Lua is
this gigantic guy right here and if we

216
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
this gigantic guy right here and if we
 

217
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,069
this gigantic guy right here and if we
can go and add one to that you're going

218
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,079
can go and add one to that you're going
 

219
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,509
can go and add one to that you're going
to see that indeed that is true so let's

220
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
to see that indeed that is true so let's
 

221
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,309
to see that indeed that is true so let's
go and try to print one more than what

222
00:03:59,309 --> 00:03:59,319
go and try to print one more than what
 

223
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,350
go and try to print one more than what
we have there with big num like this and

224
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,360
we have there with big num like this and
 

225
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,910
we have there with big num like this and
you can see it comes back out as a

226
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
you can see it comes back out as a
 

227
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,789
you can see it comes back out as a
negative number so this is as big as it

228
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:05,799
negative number so this is as big as it
 

229
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,830
negative number so this is as big as it
gets in regards to integers you could

230
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
gets in regards to integers you could
 

231
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,710
gets in regards to integers you could
easily come in here and then check the

232
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:09,720
easily come in here and then check the
 

233
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,509
easily come in here and then check the
type of this variable by just

234
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
type of this variable by just
 

235
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,190
type of this variable by just
surrounding it with type and calling the

236
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
surrounding it with type and calling the
 

237
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,030
surrounding it with type and calling the
function type jump over here and you can

238
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
function type jump over here and you can
 

239
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,069
function type jump over here and you can
see big number prints out there and

240
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:17,079
see big number prints out there and
 

241
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,749
see big number prints out there and
number prints out right there so you can

242
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:18,759
number prints out right there so you can
 

243
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,229
number prints out right there so you can
see that everything integers or floating

244
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:21,239
see that everything integers or floating
 

245
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,830
see that everything integers or floating
Point numbers are all considered just

246
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:22,840
Point numbers are all considered just
 

247
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,790
Point numbers are all considered just
basic numbers inside of L now as we all

248
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:25,800
basic numbers inside of L now as we all
 

249
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,150
basic numbers inside of L now as we all
know floating Point numbers or as some

250
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
know floating Point numbers or as some
 

251
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,070
know floating Point numbers or as some
of us know anyway floating point numbers

252
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
of us know anyway floating point numbers
 

253
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,150
of us know anyway floating point numbers
are not necessarily precise so let's

254
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
are not necessarily precise so let's
 

255
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,950
are not necessarily precise so let's
come in here and check the Precision

256
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:33,960
come in here and check the Precision
 

257
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,430
come in here and check the Precision
basically with a floating Point number

258
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
basically with a floating Point number
 

259
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,710
basically with a floating Point number
you're going to have your digits be

260
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:37,720
you're going to have your digits be
 

261
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,629
you're going to have your digits be
precise up to 13 digits so that just

262
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
precise up to 13 digits so that just
 

263
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,390
precise up to 13 digits so that just
means like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

264
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:45,400
means like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
 

265
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,950
means like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12 like that and then we could come in

266
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:47,960
12 like that and then we could come in
 

267
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,110
12 like that and then we could come in
and add another digit to it so let's

268
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,120
and add another digit to it so let's
 

269
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,950
and add another digit to it so let's
just throw in 12 zeros and then tack

270
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
just throw in 12 zeros and then tack
 

271
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,870
just throw in 12 zeros and then tack
five onto the end of it and Float

272
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
five onto the end of it and Float
 

273
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,710
five onto the end of it and Float
precision and you can see that it is

274
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
precision and you can see that it is
 

275
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,390
precision and you can see that it is
precise indeed right to that point if

276
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,400
precise indeed right to that point if
 

277
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,629
precise indeed right to that point if
however we tacked on another additional

278
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:01,639
however we tacked on another additional
 

279
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,710
however we tacked on another additional
digit onto there and reran that you're

280
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:03,720
digit onto there and reran that you're
 

281
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,870
digit onto there and reran that you're
going to see that it lost Precision so

282
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:05,880
going to see that it lost Precision so
 

283
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,670
going to see that it lost Precision so
your floating Point numbers are precise

284
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
your floating Point numbers are precise
 

285
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,749
your floating Point numbers are precise
up to 13 digits which is normally more

286
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
up to 13 digits which is normally more
 

287
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,790
up to 13 digits which is normally more
than enough now let's say that we wanted

288
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:11,800
than enough now let's say that we wanted
 

289
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,670
than enough now let's say that we wanted
to come in here and create a string that

290
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:14,680
to come in here and create a string that
 

291
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,790
to come in here and create a string that
is going to go over multiple different

292
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
is going to go over multiple different
 

293
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,670
is going to go over multiple different
lines and at the same time also keep any

294
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
lines and at the same time also keep any
 

295
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,309
lines and at the same time also keep any
white space that you would type inside

296
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:21,319
white space that you would type inside
 

297
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,189
white space that you would type inside
of here you would just put those two

298
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
of here you would just put those two
 

299
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,430
of here you would just put those two
opening brackets like that and you can

300
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
opening brackets like that and you can
 

301
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,110
opening brackets like that and you can
type in I am a forever right like this

302
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
type in I am a forever right like this
 

303
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,950
type in I am a forever right like this
and you're going to see if we run this

304
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
and you're going to see if we run this
 

305
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,870
and you're going to see if we run this
that it's going to not only print out

306
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
that it's going to not only print out
 

307
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,990
that it's going to not only print out
the whole entire string but also pay

308
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,000
the whole entire string but also pay
 

309
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,790
the whole entire string but also pay
attention to any white space and any new

310
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
attention to any white space and any new
 

311
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,710
attention to any white space and any new
lines that would occur within that long

312
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
lines that would occur within that long

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
another string there's my name if you
 

317
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,110
another string there's my name if you
wanted to combine or concatenate strings

318

wanted to combine or concatenate strings
 

319
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,150
wanted to combine or concatenate strings
inside of Lua we could just go long

320
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,160
inside of Lua we could just go long
 

321
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,309
inside of Lua we could just go long
string like this is equal to and let's

322
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:50,319
string like this is equal to and let's
 

323
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,110
string like this is equal to and let's
just use long string here you would just

324
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,120
just use long string here you would just
 

325
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,590
just use long string here you would just
put two dots inside of there and name

326
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:54,600
put two dots inside of there and name
 

327
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,510
put two dots inside of there and name
take that throw that in here instead and

328
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:56,520
take that throw that in here instead and
 

329
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,950
take that throw that in here instead and
you can see that it went in there and

330
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:57,960
you can see that it went in there and
 

331
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,070
you can see that it went in there and
automatically tacked on the other string

just with this little operator that we

334
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
just with this little operator that we
 

335
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,790
just with this little operator that we
have right there just so we can cover

336
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:03,800
have right there just so we can cover
 

337
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,749
have right there just so we can cover
other data types that are available we

338
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
other data types that are available we
 

339
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,390
other data types that are available we
also have bullion so able to drive let's

340
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,400
also have bullion so able to drive let's
 

341
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,230
also have bullion so able to drive let's
say we wanted to monitor that and a

342
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,240
say we wanted to monitor that and a
 

343
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,710
say we wanted to monitor that and a
bullion is going to either allow us to

344
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:13,720
bullion is going to either allow us to
 

345
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,790
bullion is going to either allow us to
use a value of true or a value of false

346
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
use a value of true or a value of false
 

347
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,469
use a value of true or a value of false
and of course we could come in here and

348
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
and of course we could come in here and
 

349
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,909
and of course we could come in here and
also check the type of this so is able

350
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:20,919
also check the type of this so is able
 

351
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:23,430
also check the type of this so is able
to drive like this you can see it comes

352
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
to drive like this you can see it comes
 

353
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,110
to drive like this you can see it comes
back is bullan and another thing that's

354
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
back is bullan and another thing that's
 

355
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,589
back is bullan and another thing that's
a little bit odd about Lua it doesn't go

356
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:27,599
a little bit odd about Lua it doesn't go
 

357
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,309
a little bit odd about Lua it doesn't go
out of its way to try and show errors so

358
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
out of its way to try and show errors so
 

359
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,270
out of its way to try and show errors so
let's come in here and let's try and get

360
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,280
let's come in here and let's try and get
 

361
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,430
let's come in here and let's try and get
a type of made up variable so madeup

362
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,440
a type of made up variable so madeup
 

363
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,230
a type of made up variable so madeup
variable has been basically just created

364
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,240
variable has been basically just created
 

365
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,830

right there in that line it's not been

366
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:40,840
right there in that line it's not been
 

367
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,270
right there in that line it's not been
defined with any value and you're going

368
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,280
defined with any value and you're going
 

369
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,990
defined with any value and you're going
to see right here that everything in Lua

370
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,000
to see right here that everything in Lua
 

371
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,430
to see right here that everything in Lua
by default gets the value of nil if it

372
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
by default gets the value of nil if it
 

373
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,990
by default gets the value of nil if it
does not get a value assigned

374
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,000
does not get a value assigned
 

375
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,990
does not get a value assigned
specifically by you inside of your code

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,000
specifically by you inside of your code
 

377
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,870
specifically by you inside of your code
so there's a rundown of a lot of what

378
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
so there's a rundown of a lot of what
 

379
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,670
so there's a rundown of a lot of what
you need to know about variables now

380
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:54,680
you need to know about variables now
 

381
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,589
you need to know about variables now
let's go and take a look at some math

382
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:56,599
let's go and take a look at some math
 

383
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,909
let's go and take a look at some math
functions okay so basic math functions

384
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:58,919
functions okay so basic math functions
 

385
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,749
functions okay so basic math functions
we have in little we can add subtract

386
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:00,759
we have in little we can add subtract
 

387
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,790
we have in little we can add subtract
multiply divide and this is the modulus

388
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:03,800
multiply divide and this is the modulus
 

389
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,869
multiply divide and this is the modulus
and let's just go ahead and save that

390
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:05,879
and let's just go ahead and save that
 

391
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,230
and let's just go ahead and save that
and execute it and you're going to see

392
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,240
and execute it and you're going to see
 

393
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,790
and execute it and you're going to see
exactly the results we're able to

394
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
exactly the results we're able to
 

395
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,830
exactly the results we're able to
produce here just pay attention that

396
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:10,840
produce here just pay attention that
 

397
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,869
produce here just pay attention that
this is a modulus operation right here

398
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:13,879
this is a modulus operation right here
 

399
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,309
this is a modulus operation right here
and not what is commonly known as a

400
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
and not what is commonly known as a
 

401
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,430
and not what is commonly known as a
remainder operator if it was a remainder

402
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:18,440
remainder operator if it was a remainder
 

403
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,790
remainder operator if it was a remainder
operator it would actually give the

404
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:19,800
operator it would actually give the
 

405
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,430
operator it would actually give the
value of 2.2 and this just is the

406
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,440
value of 2.2 and this just is the
 

407
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,589
value of 2.2 and this just is the
remainder of a division by three so what

408
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:24,599
remainder of a division by three so what
 

409
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,670
remainder of a division by three so what
it does is automatically cuts that off

410
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:26,680
it does is automatically cuts that off
 

411
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,309
it does is automatically cuts that off
just make you aware of that everything

412
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
just make you aware of that everything
 

413
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,270
just make you aware of that everything
else here is pretty straightforward in

414
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:30,280
else here is pretty straightforward in
 

415
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,230

regards to this basic mathematic

416
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
regards to this basic mathematic
 

417
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,469
regards to this basic mathematic
operations it's also important to know

418
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
operations it's also important to know
 

419
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,029
operations it's also important to know
that you cannot perform common shorthand

420
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
that you cannot perform common shorthand
 

421
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,270
that you cannot perform common shorthand
notation like let's say we had number

422
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
notation like let's say we had number
 

423
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,550
notation like let's say we had number
Plus+ can't do that you can't do

424
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:41,560
Plus+ can't do that you can't do
 

425
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,670
Plus+ can't do that you can't do
negative negative and of course if you

426
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
negative negative and of course if you
 

427
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,070
negative negative and of course if you
can't do those you're not going to be

428
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,080
can't do those you're not going to be
 

429
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,110
can't do those you're not going to be
able to use this or this just common

430
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,120
able to use this or this just common
 

431
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,790
able to use this or this just common
things that are in other languages that

Lua does not have currently and this is

434
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
Lua does not have currently and this is
 

435
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,950

version 5.3 of Lis so it's the most

436
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
version 5.3 of Lis so it's the most
 

437
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,869
version 5.3 of Lis so it's the most
current at least as I'm speaking right

438
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
current at least as I'm speaking right

this inside of Lua you are actually
 

449
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,469
this inside of Lua you are actually
going to have to instead type that out

450
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:09,479
going to have to instead type that out
 

451
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,309
going to have to instead type that out
there's a whole bunch of built-in math

00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:27,319
check the flooring the ceiling the max
 

469
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,629
check the flooring the ceiling the max
minimum power and square root see

470
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:29,639
minimum power and square root see
 

471
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,830
minimum power and square root see
exactly how all those operate the only

472
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
exactly how all those operate the only
 

473
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,709
exactly how all those operate the only
difference between floor and ceiling is

474
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:33,719
difference between floor and ceiling is
 

475
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,790
difference between floor and ceiling is
the floor is going to round this number

476
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:35,800
the floor is going to round this number
 

477
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,070
the floor is going to round this number
down ceiling is going to round it up and

478
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
down ceiling is going to round it up and
 

479
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,430
down ceiling is going to round it up and
you can see here Max is going to give

480
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
you can see here Max is going to give
 

481
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,310
you can see here Max is going to give
you the maximum min's going to give you

482
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:41,320
you the maximum min's going to give you
 

483
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,509
you the maximum min's going to give you
the minimum and there's power and square

484
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
the minimum and there's power and square
 

485
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,470
the minimum and there's power and square
root functions as well something that's

486
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,480
root functions as well something that's
 

487
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,389
root functions as well something that's
rather neat is using random numbers and

488
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
rather neat is using random numbers and
 

489
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,070
rather neat is using random numbers and
you will probably use random numbers a

490
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
you will probably use random numbers a
 

491
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,110
you will probably use random numbers a
lot in your programs let's go in here

492
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,120
lot in your programs let's go in here
 

493
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,590
lot in your programs let's go in here
and generate a random number right now

494
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:54,600
and generate a random number right now
 

495
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,110
and generate a random number right now
so let's just go IO right and you would

496
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
so let's just go IO right and you would
 

497
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,990
so let's just go IO right and you would
do that with math. random right like

498
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
do that with math. random right like
 

499
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,750
do that with math. random right like
this and let's say that we want to come

500
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
this and let's say that we want to come
 

501
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,750
this and let's say that we want to come
in here and generate a random number

502
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
in here and generate a random number
 

503
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,750
in here and generate a random number
between zero and one random and that is

504
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:06,760
between zero and one random and that is
 

505
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,150
between zero and one random and that is
all that we would do but that's a little

506
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
all that we would do but that's a little
 

507
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,710
all that we would do but that's a little
bit boring you may also have noticed

508
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:09,720
bit boring you may also have noticed
 

509
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,230
bit boring you may also have noticed
here there's no semicolons at the end

510
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,240
here there's no semicolons at the end
 

511
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,829
here there's no semicolons at the end
you could put semicolons in there but

512
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:12,839
you could put semicolons in there but
 

513
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,990
you could put semicolons in there but
they are not needed in any way let's go

514
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
they are not needed in any way let's go
 

515
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,509
they are not needed in any way let's go
instead and create a random number

516
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
instead and create a random number
 

517
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,269
instead and create a random number
between 1 and 10 you just come in here

518
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:20,279
between 1 and 10 you just come in here
 

519
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,150
between 1 and 10 you just come in here
type in 10 and then you could also come

520
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
type in 10 and then you could also come
 

521
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,590
type in 10 and then you could also come
in here and also Define random numbers

522
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
in here and also Define random numbers
 

523
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,630
in here and also Define random numbers
in very specific ranges so let's say we

524
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
in very specific ranges so let's say we
 

525
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,430
in very specific ranges so let's say we
wanted to go random number between five

526
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
wanted to go random number between five
 

527
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,389
wanted to go random number between five
and 100 there you go 5 and 100 5 and 100

528
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:35,399
and 100 there you go 5 and 100 5 and 100
 

529
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,069
and 100 there you go 5 and 100 5 and 100
and if you see if we execute those they

530
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:37,079
and if you see if we execute those they
 

531
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,030
and if you see if we execute those they
all work pretty simply another thing

532
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
all work pretty simply another thing
 

533
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,110
all work pretty simply another thing
that is kind of useful is we're going to

534
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
that is kind of useful is we're going to
 

535
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,870
that is kind of useful is we're going to
be able to set our seed value and that

536
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:43,880
be able to set our seed value and that
 

537
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,870
be able to set our seed value and that
is just going to help us calculate a

538
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:45,880
is just going to help us calculate a
 

539
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,990
is just going to help us calculate a
random value and how we do that is just

540
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
random value and how we do that is just
 

541
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,069
random value and how we do that is just
go math random seed and the best way to

542
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:51,079
go math random seed and the best way to
 

543
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,710
go math random seed and the best way to
do that is to use os. time right like

544
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
do that is to use os. time right like
 

545
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,350
do that is to use os. time right like
that and that is going to generate for

546
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:56,360
that and that is going to generate for
 

547
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,670
that and that is going to generate for
us a nice random value another thing

548
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:58,680
us a nice random value another thing
 

549
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,910
us a nice random value another thing
that is interesting is we can come in

550
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:00,920
that is interesting is we can come in
 

551
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,509
that is interesting is we can come in
here and print our float values uh in

552
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:04,519
here and print our float values uh in
 

553
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,069
here and print our float values uh in
other ways so let's just use print I'm

554
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
other ways so let's just use print I'm
 

555
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,870
other ways so let's just use print I'm
going to be bouncing around a lot just

556
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:07,880
going to be bouncing around a lot just
 

557
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,230
going to be bouncing around a lot just
to show you all the different ways we

558
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:09,240
to show you all the different ways we
 

559
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,110
to show you all the different ways we
can use these things if we wanted to

560
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
can use these things if we wanted to
 

561
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,910
can use these things if we wanted to
format a string we just go string format

562
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
format a string we just go string format
 

563
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,790
format a string we just go string format
and let's say that we wanted to get Pi

564
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:15,800
and let's say that we wanted to get Pi
 

565
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,990
and let's say that we wanted to get Pi
is equal to and then we wanted to import

566
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,000
is equal to and then we wanted to import
 

567
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,509
is equal to and then we wanted to import
directly into our string a value and

568
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
directly into our string a value and
 

569
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,990
directly into our string a value and
let's say that we wanted it to be 10

570
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
let's say that we wanted it to be 10
 

571
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,509
let's say that we wanted it to be 10
decimal places long f for float right

572
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:26,519
decimal places long f for float right
 

573
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,430
decimal places long f for float right
like this and we could also get the

574
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:28,440
like this and we could also get the
 

575
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,670
like this and we could also get the
value of pi by by calling the math

576
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:30,680
value of pi by by calling the math
 

577
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,470
value of pi by by calling the math
library right like this you're going to

578
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
library right like this you're going to
 

579
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,750
library right like this you're going to
see that we got the value of Pi to 10

580
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:34,760
see that we got the value of Pi to 10
 

581
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,949
see that we got the value of Pi to 10
digits automatically sorted out for us

582
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
digits automatically sorted out for us
 

583
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,829
digits automatically sorted out for us
also however be aware that this is only

584
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
also however be aware that this is only
 

585
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,310
also however be aware that this is only
going to have a Precision of 13 digits

586
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
going to have a Precision of 13 digits
 

587
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,949
going to have a Precision of 13 digits
anything over that and it's going to

588
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:43,959
anything over that and it's going to
 

589
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,110
anything over that and it's going to
start botching itself up and that's just

590
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,120
start botching itself up and that's just
 

591
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,150
start botching itself up and that's just
the way floating Point numbers work in

592
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
the way floating Point numbers work in
 

593
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,190
the way floating Point numbers work in
almost every programming language okay

594
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,200
almost every programming language okay
 

595
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,870
almost every programming language okay
so now that we got the math functions

596
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:51,880
so now that we got the math functions
 

597
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,430
so now that we got the math functions
out of the way let's take a look at

598
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
out of the way let's take a look at
 

599
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,790
out of the way let's take a look at
conditionals okay whenever we're using

600
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:55,800
conditionals okay whenever we're using
 

601
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,230
conditionals okay whenever we're using
conditional statements we're going to

602
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,240
conditional statements we're going to
 

603
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,350
conditional statements we're going to
have relational operators as well as

604
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
have relational operators as well as
 

605
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,230
have relational operators as well as
logical operators and the relational

606
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,240
logical operators and the relational
 

607
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,110
logical operators and the relational
operators going to be greater than less

608
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
operators going to be greater than less
 

609
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,150
operators going to be greater than less
than greater than or equal to less than

610
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,160
than greater than or equal to less than
 

611
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,990
than greater than or equal to less than
or equal to this is the funy one well

612
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
or equal to this is the funy one well
 

613
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,030
or equal to this is the funy one well
that's fine that's just equal but not

614
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,040
that's fine that's just equal but not
 

615
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,190
that's fine that's just equal but not
equal is actually going to be Tilda and

616
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,200
equal is actually going to be Tilda and
 

617
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,350
equal is actually going to be Tilda and
equal to very important to remember that

618
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,360
equal to very important to remember that
 

619
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,910
equal to very important to remember that
just Tilda and equal to this one right

620
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:16,920
just Tilda and equal to this one right
 

621
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,030
just Tilda and equal to this one right
here which you may be aware of is not

622
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
here which you may be aware of is not
 

623
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,150
here which you may be aware of is not
used and then your logical operators are

624
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,160
used and then your logical operators are
 

625
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,430
used and then your logical operators are
going to be and or or not spelled out

626
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:24,440
going to be and or or not spelled out
 

627
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,750
going to be and or or not spelled out
exactly like that and I'm going to

628
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
exactly like that and I'm going to
 

629
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,990
exactly like that and I'm going to
demonstrate how all of these work so

630
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
demonstrate how all of these work so
 

631
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,990
demonstrate how all of these work so
let's say you have an A AG which is

632
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
let's say you have an A AG which is
 

633
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,470
let's say you have an A AG which is
equal to 13 and let's take a look at if

634
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
equal to 13 and let's take a look at if
 

635
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,110
equal to 13 and let's take a look at if
statements and how they work now we're

636
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,120
statements and how they work now we're
 

637
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,470
statements and how they work now we're
going to be able to perform certain

638
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,480
going to be able to perform certain
 

639
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,269
going to be able to perform certain
operations depending upon the value of

640
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
operations depending upon the value of
 

641
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,710
operations depending upon the value of
age here we're just going to say if age

642
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:39,720
age here we're just going to say if age
 

643
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,990
age here we're just going to say if age
is less than 16 then make sure you put

644
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,000
is less than 16 then make sure you put
 

645
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,470
is less than 16 then make sure you put
then inside of there you're going to see

646
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
then inside of there you're going to see
 

647
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,350
then inside of there you're going to see
it automatically indents we're going to

648
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:46,360
it automatically indents we're going to
 

649
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,550
it automatically indents we're going to
say write and something like you can go

650
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
say write and something like you can go
 

651
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,750
say write and something like you can go
to school another thing to be aware of

652
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:50,760
to school another thing to be aware of
 

653
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,670
to school another thing to be aware of
is any variable that we would Define

654
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
is any variable that we would Define
 

655
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,949
is any variable that we would Define
inside of our if statements Force

656
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
inside of our if statements Force
 

657
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,509
inside of our if statements Force
statements functions so forth and so on

658
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
statements functions so forth and so on
 

659
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,949
statements functions so forth and so on
we to called local variables and that

660
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:01,959
we to called local variables and that
 

661
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,949
we to called local variables and that
just means that they are local to this

662
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:03,959
just means that they are local to this
 

663
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,310
just means that they are local to this
if statement and the value that is set

664
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
if statement and the value that is set
 

665
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,389
if statement and the value that is set
here cannot be found outside of the if

666
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
here cannot be found outside of the if
 

667
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,230
here cannot be found outside of the if
statement more on that here in a second

668
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
statement more on that here in a second
 

669
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,110
statement more on that here in a second
now if this if statement doesn't come

670
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,120
now if this if statement doesn't come
 

671
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,550
now if this if statement doesn't come
back as true maybe we want to check

672
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:13,560
back as true maybe we want to check
 

673
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,030
back as true maybe we want to check
something else so we would go else if

674
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,040
something else so we would go else if
 

675
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,189
something else so we would go else if
right like that no space between there

676
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:18,199
right like that no space between there
 

677
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,350
right like that no space between there
and then we could say something like age

678
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:20,360
and then we could say something like age
 

679
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,310
and then we could say something like age
is less than or equal to 16 and let's

680
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:23,320
is less than or equal to 16 and let's
 

681
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,590
is less than or equal to 16 and let's
say that we want to check a couple

682
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,600
say that we want to check a couple
 

683
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,310
say that we want to check a couple
things well this is where our logical

684
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
things well this is where our logical
 

685
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,870
things well this is where our logical
operators come in we can say and and we

686
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
operators come in we can say and and we
 

687
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,030
operators come in we can say and and we
can check check another one age is less

688
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
can check check another one age is less
 

689
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,110
can check check another one age is less
than or equal let's just make it less

690
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
than or equal let's just make it less
 

691
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,189
than or equal let's just make it less
than 18 like this then make sure we put

692
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:36,199
than 18 like this then make sure we put
 

693
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:37,790
than 18 like this then make sure we put
our then statement in there and then we

694
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:37,800
our then statement in there and then we
 

695
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,350
our then statement in there and then we
can come in here and print something

696
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
can come in here and print something
 

697
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,790
can come in here and print something
else out so we can say something like

698
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:41,800
else out so we can say something like
 

699
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,710
else out so we can say something like
you can drive and then finally as a

700
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
you can drive and then finally as a
 

701
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,590
you can drive and then finally as a
default we would use else throw

702
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:46,600
default we would use else throw
 

703
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,110
default we would use else throw
something else in there and you could

704
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,120
something else in there and you could
 

705
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,949
something else in there and you could
say something like you can vote another

706
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
say something like you can vote another
 

707
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,269
say something like you can vote another
thing that we have to remember is

708
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:52,279
thing that we have to remember is
 

709
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,990
thing that we have to remember is
anytime we have an if statement we

710
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
anytime we have an if statement we
 

711
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,269
anytime we have an if statement we
always want to use end there whenever it

712
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:56,279
always want to use end there whenever it
 

713
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,509
always want to use end there whenever it
is finished now let's jump back to this

714
00:12:58,509 --> 00:12:58,519
is finished now let's jump back to this
 

715
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,509
is finished now let's jump back to this
guy as well well as also check out

716
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:00,519
guy as well well as also check out
 

717
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,790
guy as well well as also check out
exactly what goes on here if we would go

718
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
exactly what goes on here if we would go
 

719
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,670
exactly what goes on here if we would go
print like this and we would go local

720
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
print like this and we would go local
 

721
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,310
print like this and we would go local
variable we're going to see what happens

722
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,320
variable we're going to see what happens
 

723
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,110
variable we're going to see what happens
here let's load this you can go to

724
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
here let's load this you can go to
 

725
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,069
here let's load this you can go to
school but this comes back as nil like I

726
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
school but this comes back as nil like I
 

727
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,389
school but this comes back as nil like I
said once you to find a variable inside

728
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
said once you to find a variable inside
 

729
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,430
said once you to find a variable inside
of here a local variable this is inside

730
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
of here a local variable this is inside
 

731
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,550
of here a local variable this is inside
of the if statement and it cannot be

732
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
of the if statement and it cannot be
 

733
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,829
of the if statement and it cannot be
accessed anywhere outside of the if

734
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
accessed anywhere outside of the if
 

735
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,110
accessed anywhere outside of the if
statement and we're going to see more

736
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
statement and we're going to see more
 

737
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,829
statement and we're going to see more
about that later on just wanted to make

738
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:24,839
about that later on just wanted to make
 

739
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,790
about that later on just wanted to make
you aware of it now we come in here and

740
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
you aware of it now we come in here and
 

741
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,629
you aware of it now we come in here and
play around with logical statements a

742
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
play around with logical statements a
 

743
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,269
play around with logical statements a
little bit more more just so we can

744
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:30,279
little bit more more just so we can
 

745
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,949
little bit more more just so we can
check out how all of them work say we

746
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:31,959
check out how all of them work say we
 

747
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,189
check out how all of them work say we
want to check if age is less than 14 and

748
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:36,199
want to check if age is less than 14 and
 

749
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,030
want to check if age is less than 14 and
we could use or which is going to give

750
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,040
we could use or which is going to give
 

751
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,230
we could use or which is going to give
you a value of true and then operate

752
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,240
you a value of true and then operate
 

753
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,910
you a value of true and then operate
with whatever is after the then

754
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
with whatever is after the then
 

755
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,990
with whatever is after the then
statement if one or the other of these

756
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
statement if one or the other of these
 

757
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,389
statement if one or the other of these
is true could say age is greater than 67

758
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
is true could say age is greater than 67
 

759
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,110
is true could say age is greater than 67
like this and you could just keep on

760
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,120
like this and you could just keep on
 

761
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,389
like this and you could just keep on
going you could go iio right like this

762
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
going you could go iio right like this
 

763
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,189
going you could go iio right like this
just keep CH just keep typing

764
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:56,199
just keep CH just keep typing
 

765
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,670
just keep CH just keep typing
everything's going to work say like you

766
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:58,680
everything's going to work say like you
 

767
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,710
everything's going to work say like you
should

768
00:13:59,710 --> 00:13:59,720
should
 

769
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,629
should
work and then we could continue on the

770
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:01,639
work and then we could continue on the
 

771
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,389
work and then we could continue on the
same line and then end and don't forget

772
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
same line and then end and don't forget
 

773
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,269
same line and then end and don't forget
to come in here and put an age in like

774
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:06,279
to come in here and put an age in like
 

775
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,230
to come in here and put an age in like
that and come up here and execute it and

776
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
that and come up here and execute it and
 

777
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,910
that and come up here and execute it and
you can see you shouldn't work comes

778
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
you can see you shouldn't work comes
 

779
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,710
you can see you shouldn't work comes
back because 13 is the value right here

780
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
back because 13 is the value right here
 

781
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,310
back because 13 is the value right here
this comes back as true which means that

782
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
this comes back as true which means that
 

783
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,069
this comes back as true which means that
we are going to print you shouldn't work

784
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
we are going to print you shouldn't work
 

785
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,670
we are going to print you shouldn't work
out onto the screen now you can do this

786
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:18,680
out onto the screen now you can do this
 

787
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,030
out onto the screen now you can do this
but it kind of gets sloppy so watch out

788
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
but it kind of gets sloppy so watch out
 

789
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,590
but it kind of gets sloppy so watch out
there just wanted to demonstrate how The

790
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:22,600
there just wanted to demonstrate how The
 

791
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,470
there just wanted to demonstrate how The
Logical operator works and also make you

792
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
Logical operator works and also make you
 

793
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,470
Logical operator works and also make you
aware that you may see people use really

794
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
aware that you may see people use really
 

795
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,710
aware that you may see people use really
sloppy long statements like that now

796
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
sloppy long statements like that now
 

797
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,509
sloppy long statements like that now
we're going to also be able to come in

798
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:30,519
we're going to also be able to come in
 

799
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,230
we're going to also be able to come in
here and format or convert from multiple

800
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,240
here and format or convert from multiple
 

801
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,629
here and format or convert from multiple
different variable types to other

802
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
different variable types to other
 

803
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,430
different variable types to other
different variable types so let's just

804
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:36,440
different variable types so let's just
 

805
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,189
different variable types so let's just
come in here and go print and string and

806
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
come in here and go print and string and
 

807
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,670
come in here and go print and string and
then use format again and I'm going to

808
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
then use format again and I'm going to
 

809
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,990
then use format again and I'm going to
demonstrate the not logical operator as

810
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
demonstrate the not logical operator as
 

811
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,350
demonstrate the not logical operator as
well so let's say not true what will

812
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,360
well so let's say not true what will
 

813
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,550
well so let's say not true what will
that do well I'm going to come in here

814
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
that do well I'm going to come in here
 

815
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,310
that do well I'm going to come in here
and if you want to put a string inside

816
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
and if you want to put a string inside
 

817
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,030
and if you want to put a string inside
of here you would just put a percent

818
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,040
of here you would just put a percent
 

819
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,389
of here you would just put a percent
sign and an S like that however we're

820
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
sign and an S like that however we're
 

821
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,590
sign and an S like that however we're
going to have to convert our bullan to a

822
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:56,600
going to have to convert our bullan to a
 

823
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,350
going to have to convert our bullan to a
string and how we do a cast or convert

824
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
string and how we do a cast or convert
 

825
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,030
string and how we do a cast or convert
to a string you can throw anything

826
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
to a string you can throw anything
 

827
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,350
to a string you can throw anything
inside here throw a number or whatever

828
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
inside here throw a number or whatever
 

829
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,310
inside here throw a number or whatever
and you can see right here the not true

830
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,320
and you can see right here the not true
 

831
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,350
and you can see right here the not true
part right there and if we save that you

832
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
part right there and if we save that you
 

833
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,629
part right there and if we save that you
can see that not true this logical

834
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:09,639
can see that not true this logical
 

835
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,470
can see that not true this logical
operator before the value of true is

836
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:11,480
operator before the value of true is
 

837
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,949
operator before the value of true is
going to give us a value of false and

838
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
going to give us a value of false and
 

839
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,310
going to give us a value of false and
you can also see how the bullan value

840
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,320
you can also see how the bullan value
 

841
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,870
you can also see how the bullan value
this guy right here was converted to a

842
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
this guy right here was converted to a
 

843
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,670
this guy right here was converted to a
string so we could use it inside of our

844
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
string so we could use it inside of our
 

845
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,949
string so we could use it inside of our
print statement now there is no Turner

846
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:21,959
print statement now there is no Turner
 

847
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,710
print statement now there is no Turner
operator inside of Lua and a tary

848
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
operator inside of Lua and a tary
 

849
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,430
operator inside of Lua and a tary
operator normally looks like something

850
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:26,440
operator normally looks like something
 

851
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,389
operator normally looks like something
like can vote is equal to age greater

852
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:29,399
like can vote is equal to age greater
 

853
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,509
like can vote is equal to age greater
than 18 like this and otherwise false

854
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
than 18 like this and otherwise false
 

855
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,150
than 18 like this and otherwise false
that's what a Turner operator looks like

856
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,160
that's what a Turner operator looks like
 

857
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,629
that's what a Turner operator looks like
in other programming languages and it

858
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
in other programming languages and it
 

859
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,030
in other programming languages and it
basically just says if age is greater

860
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
basically just says if age is greater
 

861
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,150
basically just says if age is greater
than 18 we want to assign the value of

862
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,160
than 18 we want to assign the value of
 

863
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,590
than 18 we want to assign the value of
true to the variable can vote otherwise

864
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
true to the variable can vote otherwise
 

865
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,670
true to the variable can vote otherwise
we want to assign the value of false to

866
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
we want to assign the value of false to
 

867
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,910
we want to assign the value of false to
the variable can vote so we can't do

868
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
the variable can vote so we can't do
 

869
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,870
the variable can vote so we can't do
that however we can pretty much knock it

870
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:49,880
that however we can pretty much knock it
 

871
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,309
that however we can pretty much knock it
off inside of Lua how we would do that

872
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:52,319
off inside of Lua how we would do that
 

873
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,470
off inside of Lua how we would do that
is go can vote is equal to and we could

874
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:55,480
is go can vote is equal to and we could
 

875
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,550
is go can vote is equal to and we could
go age is greater than 18 and true or

876
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
go age is greater than 18 and true or
 

877
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,470
go age is greater than 18 and true or
false so it looks very similar to the

878
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:03,480
false so it looks very similar to the
 

879
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,309
false so it looks very similar to the
tary operator and it works exactly like

880
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:06,319
tary operator and it works exactly like
 

881
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,350
tary operator and it works exactly like
the tary operator and we could say can I

882
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
the tary operator and we could say can I
 

883
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,430
the tary operator and we could say can I
vote and we can come in here and go to

884
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
vote and we can come in here and go to
 

885
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,230
vote and we can come in here and go to
string again and can vote let's change

886
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
string again and can vote let's change
 

887
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,230
string again and can vote let's change
this to can vote and you can see right

888
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
this to can vote and you can see right
 

889
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,509
this to can vote and you can see right
here the answer comes back as false so

890
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:18,519
here the answer comes back as false so
 

891
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,150
here the answer comes back as false so
there's an example of how we can use

892
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,160
there's an example of how we can use
 

893
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,309
there's an example of how we can use
conditional statements or if else and

894
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:23,319
conditional statements or if else and
 

895
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:26,030
conditional statements or if else and
else as well as knock off a tary

896
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,040
else as well as knock off a tary
 

897
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,949
else as well as knock off a tary
operator and it's also good to know that

898
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:27,959
operator and it's also good to know that
 

899
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,150
operator and it's also good to know that
there is no such thing thing as switch

900
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
there is no such thing thing as switch
 

901
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,509
there is no such thing thing as switch
inside of Lua but you can also basically

902
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:32,519
inside of Lua but you can also basically
 

903
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,389
inside of Lua but you can also basically
knock that off with if and else

904
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
knock that off with if and else
 

905
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,230
knock that off with if and else
statements now let's go and take a look

906
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
statements now let's go and take a look
 

907
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,509
statements now let's go and take a look
at some strings and ways that we can

908
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:38,519
at some strings and ways that we can
 

909
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,910
at some strings and ways that we can
work with them okay so I went and

910
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:40,920
work with them okay so I went and
 

911
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,470
work with them okay so I went and
created a really really long string

912
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:43,480
created a really really long string
 

913
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,949
created a really really long string
right here for us to be able to play

914
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
right here for us to be able to play
 

915
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,389
right here for us to be able to play
around with and I'm just going to do a

916
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
around with and I'm just going to do a
 

917
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,350
around with and I'm just going to do a
couple simple little string operations

918
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,360
couple simple little string operations
 

919
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,389
couple simple little string operations
that are common and then as the tutorial

920
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
that are common and then as the tutorial
 

921
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,309
that are common and then as the tutorial
continues I'll cover some more so let's

922
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:52,319
continues I'll cover some more so let's
 

923
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:53,829
continues I'll cover some more so let's
go and say that we wanted to do

924
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
go and say that we wanted to do
 

925
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,309
go and say that we wanted to do
something like get the quote length

926
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:56,319
something like get the quote length
 

927
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,790
something like get the quote length
right like this we could come in and go

928
00:16:59,790 --> 00:16:59,800
right like this we could come in and go
 

929
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,790
right like this we could come in and go
Len and then throw quote inside of there

930
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
Len and then throw quote inside of there
 

931
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,029
Len and then throw quote inside of there
and then make sure we separate

932
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:04,039
and then make sure we separate
 

933
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,309
and then make sure we separate
everything with commas and you can see

934
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
everything with commas and you can see
 

935
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,990
everything with commas and you can see
right there the quote length comes back

936
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
right there the quote length comes back
 

937
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,710
right there the quote length comes back
at 111 characters and we can come in

938
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
at 111 characters and we can come in
 

939
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,510
at 111 characters and we can come in
here also and see that we can just go

940
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:12,520
here also and see that we can just go
 

941
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,390
here also and see that we can just go
like this and then throw the number sign

942
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
like this and then throw the number sign
 

943
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,510
like this and then throw the number sign
inside of there and get exactly the same

944
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:16,520
inside of there and get exactly the same
 

945
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,150
inside of there and get exactly the same
result this is the most common way to

946
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
result this is the most common way to
 

947
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,590
result this is the most common way to
check the number of characters that you

948
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
check the number of characters that you
 

949
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,110
check the number of characters that you
have in your string by the way you could

950
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
have in your string by the way you could
 

951
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,630
have in your string by the way you could
also come in here and replace certain

952
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:23,640
also come in here and replace certain
 

953
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,510
also come in here and replace certain
strings so let's say that we wanted to

954
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
strings so let's say that we wanted to
 

955
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,309
strings so let's say that we wanted to
replace I this is going to be bad

956
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:27,319
replace I this is going to be bad
 

957
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,150
replace I this is going to be bad
English but replace I with me for

958
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
English but replace I with me for
 

959
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,909
English but replace I with me for
example we could then go string dog sub

960
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
example we could then go string dog sub
 

961
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,630
example we could then go string dog sub
like this and then you're going to put

962
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:35,640
like this and then you're going to put
 

963
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,430
like this and then you're going to put
inside of there the string that you're

964
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
inside of there the string that you're
 

965
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,830
inside of there the string that you're
going to want to change and the value

966
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
going to want to change and the value
 

967
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,630
going to want to change and the value
that you're going to want to change and

968
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:41,640
that you're going to want to change and
 

969
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,350
that you're going to want to change and
then the value you're going to want to

970
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
then the value you're going to want to
 

971
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,909
then the value you're going to want to
replace that with so we'll say me and

972
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
replace that with so we'll say me and
 

973
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,630
replace that with so we'll say me and
said like that and always make sure that

974
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:47,640
said like that and always make sure that
 

975
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,909
said like that and always make sure that
you close off all of your brackets so

976
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
you close off all of your brackets so
 

977
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,350
you close off all of your brackets so
make sure you have a closing one for

978
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
make sure you have a closing one for
 

979
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,270
make sure you have a closing one for
this one and file save and execute

980
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
this one and file save and execute
 

981
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,110
this one and file save and execute
you're going to see right here replace I

982
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
you're going to see right here replace I
 

983
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,549
you're going to see right here replace I
with me and it went and changed all of

984
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:57,559
with me and it went and changed all of
 

985
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,549
with me and it went and changed all of
the versions of I and inside of this

986
00:17:59,549 --> 00:17:59,559
the versions of I and inside of this
 

987
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,830
the versions of I and inside of this
great big giant string to me instead so

988
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
great big giant string to me instead so
 

989
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,470
great big giant string to me instead so
it says me changed my password to

990
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:03,480
it says me changed my password to
 

991
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,070
it says me changed my password to
Incorrect and da da da da da another

992
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,080
Incorrect and da da da da da another
 

993
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,230
Incorrect and da da da da da another
thing that we can do is find any

994
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,240
thing that we can do is find any
 

995
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,470
thing that we can do is find any
matching indexes everything inside in

996
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
matching indexes everything inside in
 

997
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,029
matching indexes everything inside in
regards to Strings is going to have an

998
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
regards to Strings is going to have an
 

999
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,909
regards to Strings is going to have an
index every character so this is going

1000
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:14,919
index every character so this is going
 

1001
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,270
index every character so this is going
to have the index of zero this space

1002
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
to have the index of zero this space
 

1003
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,590
to have the index of zero this space
right here is going to have the index of

1004
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:18,600
right here is going to have the index of
 

1005
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,430
right here is going to have the index of
one this is going to have the index of

1006
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,440
one this is going to have the index of
 

1007
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,430
one this is going to have the index of
two and we'll be able to search through

1008
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,440
two and we'll be able to search through
 

1009
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,470
two and we'll be able to search through
this grapic giant long quote and find

1010
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
this grapic giant long quote and find
 

1011
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,750
this grapic giant long quote and find
out exactly what the index is so we

1012
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:26,760
out exactly what the index is so we
 

1013
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,870
out exactly what the index is so we
could say something like index of the

1014
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
could say something like index of the
 

1015
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,990
could say something like index of the
word password and we're going to use

1016
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,000
word password and we're going to use
 

1017
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,630
word password and we're going to use
string doind and again we're going to

1018
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:33,640
string doind and again we're going to
 

1019
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,549
string doind and again we're going to
pass in the string that we are going to

1020
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:35,559
pass in the string that we are going to
 

1021
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,830
pass in the string that we are going to
be searching for and then the word that

1022
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
be searching for and then the word that
 

1023
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,510
be searching for and then the word that
we're going to be searching for which in

1024
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
we're going to be searching for which in
 

1025
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,710
we're going to be searching for which in
this situation is going to be password

1026
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:41,720
this situation is going to be password
 

1027
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,149
this situation is going to be password
and make sure we put a little common

1028
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:44,159
and make sure we put a little common
 

1029
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,870
and make sure we put a little common
side of there and you can see right here

1030
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:45,880
side of there and you can see right here
 

1031
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,310
side of there and you can see right here
index of password is 14 so that's 14

1032
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
index of password is 14 so that's 14
 

1033
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,149
index of password is 14 so that's 14
characters into our great big giant

1034
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:50,159
characters into our great big giant
 

1035
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:52,390
characters into our great big giant
along quote is the location of the word

1036
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
along quote is the location of the word
 

1037
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,590
along quote is the location of the word
password and two other little simple

1038
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:54,600
password and two other little simple
 

1039
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,070
password and two other little simple
things we can do let's say that we

1040
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
things we can do let's say that we
 

1041
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,029
things we can do let's say that we
wanted to make all of the characters

1042
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
wanted to make all of the characters
 

1043
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,950
wanted to make all of the characters
inside of our quote uppercase we could

1044
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
inside of our quote uppercase we could
 

1045
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,190
inside of our quote uppercase we could
just put string upper or lowercase we

1046
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
just put string upper or lowercase we
 

1047
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,390
just put string upper or lowercase we
could just go string. lower save that

1048
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:05,400
could just go string. lower save that
 

1049
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,190
could just go string. lower save that
execute and you can see right here made

1050
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
execute and you can see right here made
 

1051
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,909
execute and you can see right here made
everything uppercase and everything

1052
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:08,919
everything uppercase and everything
 

1053
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,510
everything uppercase and everything
lowercase now we're going to get more

1054
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:10,520
lowercase now we're going to get more
 

1055
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,710
lowercase now we're going to get more
into Strings here in a second but let's

1056
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
into Strings here in a second but let's
 

1057
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,430
into Strings here in a second but let's
go and jump in and take a look at

1058
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:14,440
go and jump in and take a look at
 

1059
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,870
go and jump in and take a look at
looping and how that works inside of Lua

1060
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
looping and how that works inside of Lua
 

1061
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,070
looping and how that works inside of Lua
I'm going to start off with a while loop

1062
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,080
I'm going to start off with a while loop
 

1063
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,710
I'm going to start off with a while loop
and what we're going to need to do is

1064
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
and what we're going to need to do is
 

1065
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,470
and what we're going to need to do is
initialize or create a variable that is

1066
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
initialize or create a variable that is
 

1067
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,750
initialize or create a variable that is
going to define the starting value that

1068
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:24,760
going to define the starting value that
 

1069
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,590
going to define the starting value that
we're going to be looping through and

1070
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:26,600
we're going to be looping through and
 

1071
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,830
we're going to be looping through and
then we're going to say something like

1072
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:27,840
then we're going to say something like
 

1073
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,390
then we're going to say something like
while I I the value of I is less than or

1074
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,400
while I I the value of I is less than or
 

1075
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,590
while I I the value of I is less than or
equal to 10 we want to continue looping

1076
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:34,600
equal to 10 we want to continue looping
 

1077
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,870
equal to 10 we want to continue looping
through or executing code inside of our

1078
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
through or executing code inside of our
 

1079
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,070
through or executing code inside of our
while loop so let's just say we got IO

1080
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,080
while loop so let's just say we got IO
 

1081
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,630
while loop so let's just say we got IO
right and we just want to print out the

1082
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
right and we just want to print out the
 

1083
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,310
right and we just want to print out the
value of I there you go and inside your

1084
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:43,320
value of I there you go and inside your
 

1085
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,190
value of I there you go and inside your
while loop you're of course going to

1086
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
while loop you're of course going to
 

1087
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,789
while loop you're of course going to
have to increment the value of I

1088
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
have to increment the value of I
 

1089
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,750
have to increment the value of I
remember we can't do something like this

1090
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:48,760
remember we can't do something like this
 

1091
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,270
remember we can't do something like this
not allowed you have to type everything

1092
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,280
not allowed you have to type everything
 

1093
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,029
not allowed you have to type everything
out and then let's also say that we

1094
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:52,039
out and then let's also say that we
 

1095
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,789
out and then let's also say that we
would want to jump completely out of

1096
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
would want to jump completely out of
 

1097
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,830
would want to jump completely out of
this Loop and not continue looping

1098
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:56,840
this Loop and not continue looping
 

1099
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,669
this Loop and not continue looping
through it anymore if for example I has

1100
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
through it anymore if for example I has
 

1101
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,029
through it anymore if for example I has
a value of 8 well then we're going to

1102
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:02,039
a value of 8 well then we're going to
 

1103
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,430
a value of 8 well then we're going to
say something like break and of course

1104
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:04,440
say something like break and of course
 

1105
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,430
say something like break and of course
we have to put an end right there that's

1106
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:06,440
we have to put an end right there that's
 

1107
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,990
we have to put an end right there that's
going to end our if statement but then

1108
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
going to end our if statement but then
 

1109
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,070
going to end our if statement but then
we're going to need another end that is

1110
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
we're going to need another end that is
 

1111
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,390
we're going to need another end that is
actually going to end our while loop and

1112
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
actually going to end our while loop and
 

1113
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,029
actually going to end our while loop and
then we could do something like print

1114
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:14,039
then we could do something like print
 

1115
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,630
then we could do something like print
and throw a new line in there you going

1116
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:15,640
and throw a new line in there you going
 

1117
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,950
and throw a new line in there you going
see if we execute that it's going to

1118
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
see if we execute that it's going to
 

1119
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,830
see if we execute that it's going to
print out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and it didn't

1120
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
print out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and it didn't
 

1121
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,350
print out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and it didn't
continue printing up until 9 and 10

1122
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,360
continue printing up until 9 and 10
 

1123
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,390
continue printing up until 9 and 10
because right here we said if it gets to

1124
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
because right here we said if it gets to
 

1125
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,029
because right here we said if it gets to
the value of eight we want to jump

1126
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,039
the value of eight we want to jump
 

1127
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,110
the value of eight we want to jump
outside of the loop and stop executing

1128
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,120
outside of the loop and stop executing
 

1129
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,909
outside of the loop and stop executing
all together also very important inside

1130
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
all together also very important inside
 

1131
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,870
all together also very important inside
of Lua to understand there is no

1132
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:31,880
of Lua to understand there is no
 

1133
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,870
of Lua to understand there is no
continue statement so you might be used

1134
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:33,880
continue statement so you might be used
 

1135
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,470
continue statement so you might be used
to that in other programming languages

1136
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:35,480
to that in other programming languages
 

1137
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,070
to that in other programming languages
but it's not going to work here another

1138
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,080
but it's not going to work here another
 

1139
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,470
but it's not going to work here another
thing we can do and this is more like

1140
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:39,480
thing we can do and this is more like
 

1141
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,230
thing we can do and this is more like
the common do wow Loop in other

1142
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
the common do wow Loop in other
 

1143
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,070
the common do wow Loop in other
programming languages we have something

1144
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
programming languages we have something
 

1145
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,590
programming languages we have something
else that is called the repeat statement

1146
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:46,600
else that is called the repeat statement
 

1147
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,470
else that is called the repeat statement
so we're going to say repeat and we're

1148
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
so we're going to say repeat and we're
 

1149
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,630
so we're going to say repeat and we're
going to continue to execute code inside

1150
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:51,640
going to continue to execute code inside
 

1151
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,789
going to continue to execute code inside
here as long as a condition is true and

1152
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:53,799
here as long as a condition is true and
 

1153
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,669
here as long as a condition is true and
let's come in here and also demonstrate

1154
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
let's come in here and also demonstrate
 

1155
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,710
let's come in here and also demonstrate
exactly how you can get user input from

1156
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:57,720
exactly how you can get user input from
 

1157
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,710
exactly how you can get user input from
somebody so we'll say enter your guess

1158
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
somebody so we'll say enter your guess
 

1159
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,669
somebody so we'll say enter your guess
like that we could then come down and

1160
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:02,679
like that we could then come down and
 

1161
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,630
like that we could then come down and
store inside of the variable guess

1162
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:05,640
store inside of the variable guess
 

1163
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,630
store inside of the variable guess
whatever they enter in the keyboard and

1164
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:07,640
whatever they enter in the keyboard and
 

1165
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,430
whatever they enter in the keyboard and
that is how easy it is to get keyboard

1166
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,440
that is how easy it is to get keyboard
 

1167
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,549
that is how easy it is to get keyboard
input just io. read and then you're

1168
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:11,559
input just io. read and then you're
 

1169
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,549
input just io. read and then you're
going to come down here and you're going

1170
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
going to come down here and you're going
 

1171
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,590
going to come down here and you're going
to define the condition that this is

1172
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:14,600
to define the condition that this is
 

1173
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,510
to define the condition that this is
going to continue looping now we are

1174
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:16,520
going to continue looping now we are
 

1175
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,669
going to continue looping now we are
going to want to convert the guess that

1176
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:18,679
going to want to convert the guess that
 

1177
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,230
going to want to convert the guess that
they made it's automatically going to be

1178
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
they made it's automatically going to be
 

1179
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,269
they made it's automatically going to be
stored at as a string so we want to

1180
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:22,279
stored at as a string so we want to
 

1181
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,990
stored at as a string so we want to
convert it into a number remember if we

1182
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
convert it into a number remember if we
 

1183
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,149
convert it into a number remember if we
want to convert two strings we type in

1184
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
want to convert two strings we type in
 

1185
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,070
want to convert two strings we type in
string like that but in this situation

1186
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,080
string like that but in this situation
 

1187
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,310
string like that but in this situation
we want to convert it into a number so

1188
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
we want to convert it into a number so
 

1189
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,870
we want to convert it into a number so
we're just going to put guest inside of

1190
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:31,880
we're just going to put guest inside of
 

1191
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,029
we're just going to put guest inside of
there and then we're going to say equals

1192
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:34,039
there and then we're going to say equals
 

1193
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,710
there and then we're going to say equals
to 15 so this is going to be a little

1194
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
to 15 so this is going to be a little
 

1195
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,590
to 15 so this is going to be a little
number guessing game in which it will

1196
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:38,600
number guessing game in which it will
 

1197
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,029
number guessing game in which it will
continue asking them for a guess until

1198
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
continue asking them for a guess until
 

1199
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,909
continue asking them for a guess until
they enter in 15 we type in that and

1200
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
they enter in 15 we type in that and
 

1201
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,870
they enter in 15 we type in that and
there we are enter guess you can say 10

1202
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:45,880
there we are enter guess you can say 10
 

1203
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,590
there we are enter guess you can say 10
and it's going to continue to ask until

1204
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
and it's going to continue to ask until
 

1205
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,269
and it's going to continue to ask until
15 is entered and then it's going to

1206
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:49,279
15 is entered and then it's going to
 

1207
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,830
15 is entered and then it's going to
exit so that is how to convert to

1208
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:50,840
exit so that is how to convert to
 

1209
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,950
exit so that is how to convert to
numbers and that is how to use the

1210
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
numbers and that is how to use the
 

1211
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,710
numbers and that is how to use the
repeat until or what is commonly known

1212
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:55,720
repeat until or what is commonly known
 

1213
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,830
repeat until or what is commonly known
as the do while but inside of Lua it's

1214
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
as the do while but inside of Lua it's
 

1215
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,870
as the do while but inside of Lua it's
known as repeat until now let's take a

1216
00:21:59,870 --> 00:21:59,880
known as repeat until now let's take a
 

1217
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,110
known as repeat until now let's take a
look at four loops and they're a little

1218
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,120
look at four loops and they're a little
 

1219
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,549
look at four loops and they're a little
bit different what we're going to do

1220
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:03,559
bit different what we're going to do
 

1221
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,909
bit different what we're going to do
we're going to Define an iterator just

1222
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:05,919
we're going to Define an iterator just
 

1223
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,549
we're going to Define an iterator just
like we did with the while loop

1224
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:07,559
like we did with the while loop
 

1225
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,110
like we did with the while loop
previously and we're going to give it a

1226
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
previously and we're going to give it a
 

1227
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,750
previously and we're going to give it a
starting value then we're going to give

1228
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:10,760
starting value then we're going to give
 

1229
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,430
starting value then we're going to give
it an ending value and then we're going

1230
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:12,440
it an ending value and then we're going
 

1231
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,310
it an ending value and then we're going
to say how much should it increment each

1232
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
to say how much should it increment each
 

1233
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,070
to say how much should it increment each
time we're going to put a one inside of

1234
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
time we're going to put a one inside of
 

1235
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,549
time we're going to put a one inside of
there for that you could put a two you

1236
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:17,559
there for that you could put a two you
 

1237
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,789
there for that you could put a two you
put anything let's go and print the eye

1238
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:19,799
put anything let's go and print the eye
 

1239
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,149
put anything let's go and print the eye
statement you could also throw a break

1240
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:21,159
statement you could also throw a break
 

1241
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:23,070
statement you could also throw a break
statement in there as well and you can

1242
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,080
statement in there as well and you can
 

1243
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,789
statement in there as well and you can
go ahead and check out exactly how that

1244
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799
go ahead and check out exactly how that
 

1245
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,029
go ahead and check out exactly how that
would work and you can see it just

1246
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:26,039
would work and you can see it just
 

1247
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,750
would work and you can see it just
cycled through there and printed out 1

1248
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
cycled through there and printed out 1
 

1249
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,350
cycled through there and printed out 1
through 10 right on on our screen now

1250
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
through 10 right on on our screen now
 

1251
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,029
through 10 right on on our screen now
what I'm going to do is this is a table

1252
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:32,039
what I'm going to do is this is a table
 

1253
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,149
what I'm going to do is this is a table
which we're going to talk more about

1254
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:33,159
which we're going to talk more about
 

1255
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,990
which we're going to talk more about
here in a second but it's basically like

1256
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,000
here in a second but it's basically like
 

1257
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,269
here in a second but it's basically like
an array in other programming languages

1258
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:37,279
an array in other programming languages
 

1259
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,950
an array in other programming languages
it's just going to be a variable that's

1260
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
it's just going to be a variable that's
 

1261
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,070
it's just going to be a variable that's
going to allow us to store multiple

1262
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,080
going to allow us to store multiple
 

1263
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,789
going to allow us to store multiple
different values inside of it and I

1264
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
different values inside of it and I
 

1265
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,669
different values inside of it and I
jumped ahead to this right now because I

1266
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:44,679
jumped ahead to this right now because I
 

1267
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,470
jumped ahead to this right now because I
want to show you how easy it is to cycle

1268
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
want to show you how easy it is to cycle
 

1269
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,950
want to show you how easy it is to cycle
through all of these different tables so

1270
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
through all of these different tables so
 

1271
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,590
through all of these different tables so
here we'll just go four and then we'll

1272
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:50,600
here we'll just go four and then we'll
 

1273
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,830
here we'll just go four and then we'll
say key k for the key let's just call it

1274
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:53,840
say key k for the key let's just call it
 

1275
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,070
say key k for the key let's just call it
key just so you can see and value

1276
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
key just so you can see and value
 

1277
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,669
key just so you can see and value
because everything in a table is going

1278
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
because everything in a table is going
 

1279
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,950
because everything in a table is going
to have a key in a value or it's going

1280
00:22:59,950 --> 00:22:59,960
to have a key in a value or it's going
 

1281
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,630
to have a key in a value or it's going
to have an index by default if you do

1282
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:01,640
to have an index by default if you do
 

1283
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,549
to have an index by default if you do
not assign a key and we could say

1284
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:03,559
not assign a key and we could say
 

1285
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,269
not assign a key and we could say
something like pairs pairs doesn't

1286
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:05,279
something like pairs pairs doesn't
 

1287
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,590
something like pairs pairs doesn't
matter you can put anything you want

1288
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:06,600
matter you can put anything you want
 

1289
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,830
matter you can put anything you want
inside here it doesn't matter what the

1290
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
inside here it doesn't matter what the
 

1291
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,950
inside here it doesn't matter what the
name of that is and we could say months

1292
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:09,960
name of that is and we could say months
 

1293
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,029
name of that is and we could say months
and then we could say do like this and

1294
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:12,039
and then we could say do like this and
 

1295
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,390
and then we could say do like this and
then we could cycle through our table

1296
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
then we could cycle through our table
 

1297
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,870
then we could cycle through our table
just like we did cycling through indexes

1298
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
just like we did cycling through indexes
 

1299
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,470
just like we did cycling through indexes
and let's just say in this situation we

1300
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
and let's just say in this situation we
 

1301
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,230
and let's just say in this situation we
just want to print our values out to the

1302
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
just want to print our values out to the
 

1303
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,470
just want to print our values out to the
screen and of course we have to end our

1304
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
screen and of course we have to end our
 

1305
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,549
screen and of course we have to end our
for Loop right like this and of course

1306
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
for Loop right like this and of course
 

1307
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,310
for Loop right like this and of course
make sure that we put value inside of

1308
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
make sure that we put value inside of
 

1309
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,029
make sure that we put value inside of
there and not V and if we execute it

1310
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:28,039
there and not V and if we execute it
 

1311
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,630
there and not V and if we execute it
you're going to see that prints out all

1312
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:29,640
you're going to see that prints out all
 

1313
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,590
you're going to see that prints out all
of the different months with a space in

1314
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
of the different months with a space in
 

1315
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,710
of the different months with a space in
between each one of those months and of

1316
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:33,720
between each one of those months and of
 

1317
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,149
between each one of those months and of
course we're going to be able to do more

1318
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:35,159
course we're going to be able to do more
 

1319
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,870
course we're going to be able to do more
interesting things with tables and

1320
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
interesting things with tables and
 

1321
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,510
interesting things with tables and
things like that but this is just a

1322
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:38,520
things like that but this is just a
 

1323
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,990
things like that but this is just a
quick way for me to demonstrate all

1324
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
quick way for me to demonstrate all
 

1325
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,710
quick way for me to demonstrate all
those things and since I brought up

1326
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:41,720
those things and since I brought up
 

1327
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,310
those things and since I brought up
tables why don't we go take a look at

1328
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,320
tables why don't we go take a look at
 

1329
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,230
tables why don't we go take a look at
how a table works now basically as I

1330
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
how a table works now basically as I
 

1331
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,909
how a table works now basically as I
said tables are going to take the place

1332
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
said tables are going to take the place
 

1333
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,190
said tables are going to take the place
of arrays dictionaries tupes and such in

1334
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
of arrays dictionaries tupes and such in
 

1335
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,950
of arrays dictionaries tupes and such in
other programming languages and how we

1336
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
other programming languages and how we
 

1337
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,430
other programming languages and how we
can create a table is just go in here

1338
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
can create a table is just go in here
 

1339
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,590
can create a table is just go in here
and say something like a table and then

1340
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
and say something like a table and then
 

1341
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,269
and say something like a table and then
put two curly brackets like that there

1342
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279
put two curly brackets like that there
 

1343
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,950
put two curly brackets like that there
you are there you have a table we could

1344
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
you are there you have a table we could
 

1345
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,830
you are there you have a table we could
come in here and add values to the table

1346
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:02,840
come in here and add values to the table
 

1347
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,669
come in here and add values to the table
using a for Loop so we can add them just

1348
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
using a for Loop so we can add them just
 

1349
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,390
using a for Loop so we can add them just
you know on their own but this is just a

1350
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:07,400
you know on their own but this is just a
 

1351
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,590
you know on their own but this is just a
quick way to throw a whole bunch of

1352
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:08,600
quick way to throw a whole bunch of
 

1353
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,549
quick way to throw a whole bunch of
values inside of there so we'll say a

1354
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
values inside of there so we'll say a
 

1355
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,149
values inside of there so we'll say a
table and everything is going to be

1356
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
table and everything is going to be
 

1357
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,029
table and everything is going to be
stored inside of an index so this is

1358
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:14,039
stored inside of an index so this is
 

1359
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,350
stored inside of an index so this is
going to increment through different

1360
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
going to increment through different
 

1361
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,430
going to increment through different
values of I and it is going to just

1362
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
values of I and it is going to just
 

1363
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,430
values of I and it is going to just
assign those values to I and this is the

1364
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:20,440
assign those values to I and this is the
 

1365
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,510
assign those values to I and this is the
index so the very first index in our

1366
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:22,520
index so the very first index in our
 

1367
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,190
index so the very first index in our
table is going to have the value of one

1368
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,200
table is going to have the value of one
 

1369
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,710
table is going to have the value of one
just like you see right there and then

1370
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:25,720
just like you see right there and then
 

1371
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,350
just like you see right there and then
of course we're going to end that and

1372
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
of course we're going to end that and
 

1373
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,789
of course we're going to end that and
we're going to be able to commit here

1374
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
we're going to be able to commit here
 

1375
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,830
we're going to be able to commit here
then and access those using the index

1376
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:31,840
then and access those using the index
 

1377
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,710
then and access those using the index
that we assigned so let's say we want

1378
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:33,720
that we assigned so let's say we want
 

1379
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,710
that we assigned so let's say we want
the very first value stored inside of

1380
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:35,720
the very first value stored inside of
 

1381
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,350
the very first value stored inside of
their index you're going to see that we

1382
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
their index you're going to see that we
 

1383
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,430
their index you're going to see that we
have one there once again because we

1384
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
have one there once again because we
 

1385
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,310
have one there once again because we
assigned it that way could also be zero

1386
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:41,320
assigned it that way could also be zero
 

1387
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,789
assigned it that way could also be zero
or could be anything else and you can

1388
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
or could be anything else and you can
 

1389
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,909
or could be anything else and you can
see first comes back as one right like

1390
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:44,919
see first comes back as one right like
 

1391
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,990
see first comes back as one right like
this so that's one way to access values

1392
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,000
this so that's one way to access values
 

1393
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,669
this so that's one way to access values
inside of a table you could probably

1394
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:48,679
inside of a table you could probably
 

1395
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,950
inside of a table you could probably
guess exactly how we would find out the

1396
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
guess exactly how we would find out the
 

1397
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,830
guess exactly how we would find out the
number of items that we have inside of

1398
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:52,840
number of items that we have inside of
 

1399
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,470
number of items that we have inside of
our table let's just come in here why

1400
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:54,480
our table let's just come in here why
 

1401
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,070
our table let's just come in here why
don't you guess okay time's up and let's

1402
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,080
don't you guess okay time's up and let's
 

1403
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,630
don't you guess okay time's up and let's
just put a number sign in table table

1404
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
just put a number sign in table table
 

1405
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,389
just put a number sign in table table
inside of there and that is exactly how

1406
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:00,399
inside of there and that is exactly how
 

1407
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,909
inside of there and that is exactly how
we're going to be able to access those

1408
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
we're going to be able to access those
 

1409
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,669
we're going to be able to access those
values and you can see number of items

1410
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
values and you can see number of items
 

1411
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,269
values and you can see number of items
is equal to 10 just like you may have

1412
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
is equal to 10 just like you may have
 

1413
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,389
is equal to 10 just like you may have
thought we could also come in here and

1414
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:07,399
thought we could also come in here and
 

1415
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:10,070
thought we could also come in here and
insert a value inside of a table we're

1416
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
insert a value inside of a table we're
 

1417
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,549
insert a value inside of a table we're
going to put table don't let this

1418
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:11,559
going to put table don't let this
 

1419
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,269
going to put table don't let this
confuse you a table is the table table

1420
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:14,279
confuse you a table is the table table
 

1421
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,990
confuse you a table is the table table
is the library we're going to use here

1422
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
is the library we're going to use here
 

1423
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,070
is the library we're going to use here
and if we want to insert a value we just

1424
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,080
and if we want to insert a value we just
 

1425
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,310
and if we want to insert a value we just
go table insert Define the table we want

1426
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
go table insert Define the table we want
 

1427
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,549
go table insert Define the table we want
to insert into we then Define the index

1428
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:23,559
to insert into we then Define the index
 

1429
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,950
to insert into we then Define the index
that we want to insert into and then the

1430
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:25,960
that we want to insert into and then the
 

1431
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,070
that we want to insert into and then the
value we would want to insert and there

1432
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
value we would want to insert and there
 

1433
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,669
value we would want to insert and there
you can can see it didn't do anything

1434
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
you can can see it didn't do anything
 

1435
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,269
you can can see it didn't do anything
let's go and print that out and you'll

1436
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
let's go and print that out and you'll
 

1437
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,990
let's go and print that out and you'll
see it go like this and first and let's

1438
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,000
see it go like this and first and let's
 

1439
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,269
see it go like this and first and let's
just let that set for one and we go like

1440
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:36,279
just let that set for one and we go like
 

1441
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,110
just let that set for one and we go like
this and now you can see the value of

1442
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,120
this and now you can see the value of
 

1443
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,950
this and now you can see the value of
the first index inside of our table is

1444
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:39,960
the first index inside of our table is
 

1445
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,909
the first index inside of our table is
now zero could also come in here and

1446
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
now zero could also come in here and
 

1447
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,710
now zero could also come in here and
change this to 10 you can see everything

1448
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:43,720
change this to 10 you can see everything
 

1449
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,789
change this to 10 you can see everything
was moved up as well so there's N9

1450
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:45,799
was moved up as well so there's N9
 

1451
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,389
was moved up as well so there's N9
instead of 10 which it would have

1452
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:47,399
instead of 10 which it would have
 

1453
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,310
instead of 10 which it would have
originally been set for we could also

1454
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,320
originally been set for we could also
 

1455
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,549
originally been set for we could also
come in here and take a table and

1456
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:51,559
come in here and take a table and
 

1457
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:53,830
come in here and take a table and
convert it into a string and then Define

1458
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840
convert it into a string and then Define
 

1459
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,590
convert it into a string and then Define
how we want all the different items to

1460
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
how we want all the different items to
 

1461
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,950
how we want all the different items to
be separated let's just use print again

1462
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:57,960
be separated let's just use print again
 

1463
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,070
be separated let's just use print again
here how we would do that is table

1464
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,080
here how we would do that is table
 

1465
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,110
here how we would do that is table
concat concatenate or combine same thing

1466
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
concat concatenate or combine same thing
 

1467
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,990
concat concatenate or combine same thing
and table and then we could Define how

1468
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,000
and table and then we could Define how
 

1469
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,909
and table and then we could Define how
we want all those items to be separated

1470
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:06,919
we want all those items to be separated
 

1471
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:08,549
we want all those items to be separated
let's say we want to be separated with a

1472
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
let's say we want to be separated with a
 

1473
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,710
let's say we want to be separated with a
comma could do that come over here and

1474
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:10,720
comma could do that come over here and
 

1475
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,510
comma could do that come over here and
there we can see exactly how that prints

1476
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:12,520
there we can see exactly how that prints
 

1477
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,470
there we can see exactly how that prints
out you can also see the zeros in there

1478
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
out you can also see the zeros in there
 

1479
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,510
out you can also see the zeros in there
because we inserted it in there another

1480
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:16,520
because we inserted it in there another
 

1481
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,549
because we inserted it in there another
thing we can do with tables is remove an

1482
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559
thing we can do with tables is remove an
 

1483
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,430
thing we can do with tables is remove an
item at a specific index we would just

1484
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:20,440
item at a specific index we would just
 

1485
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,510
item at a specific index we would just
go table remove and Define the table we

1486
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520
go table remove and Define the table we
 

1487
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,669
go table remove and Define the table we
want to remove and the index we want to

1488
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
want to remove and the index we want to
 

1489
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,630
want to remove and the index we want to
remove from copy this just so we can

1490
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:27,640
remove from copy this just so we can
 

1491
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,389
remove from copy this just so we can
print this out again and you can see

1492
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:29,399
print this out again and you can see
 

1493
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,190
print this out again and you can see
went and removed the zero out of there

1494
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
went and removed the zero out of there
 

1495
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,549
went and removed the zero out of there
and we could also come in here and

1496
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
and we could also come in here and
 

1497
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,870
and we could also come in here and
create multi-dimensional arrays so let's

1498
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
create multi-dimensional arrays so let's
 

1499
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,590
create multi-dimensional arrays so let's
go multi or multi-dimensional tables

1500
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
go multi or multi-dimensional tables
 

1501
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,269
go multi or multi-dimensional tables
sorry about that again we're going to

1502
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
sorry about that again we're going to
 

1503
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,269
sorry about that again we're going to
create our table right like this and

1504
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
create our table right like this and
 

1505
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,389
create our table right like this and
we'll use a for Loop to come in here and

1506
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:43,399
we'll use a for Loop to come in here and
 

1507
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:44,909
we'll use a for Loop to come in here and
populate this whole entire thing so

1508
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:44,919
populate this whole entire thing so
 

1509
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,110
populate this whole entire thing so
we'll say 0 through 9 do then we'll go

1510
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,120
we'll say 0 through 9 do then we'll go
 

1511
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,350
we'll say 0 through 9 do then we'll go
multi-table like this we're going to

1512
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,360
multi-table like this we're going to
 

1513
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,149
multi-table like this we're going to
Define an index so we want to save

1514
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
Define an index so we want to save
 

1515
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,310
Define an index so we want to save
inside of there and that is also going

1516
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
inside of there and that is also going
 

1517
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,630
inside of there and that is also going
to be a table create another for Loop

1518
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
to be a table create another for Loop
 

1519
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,310
to be a table create another for Loop
that is going to also p populate this

1520
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,320
that is going to also p populate this
 

1521
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,269
that is going to also p populate this
guy so we'll go 0 through 9 again and do

1522
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:02,279
guy so we'll go 0 through 9 again and do
 

1523
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,269
guy so we'll go 0 through 9 again and do
and then a multi-table and we'll say I

1524
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
and then a multi-table and we'll say I
 

1525
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,710
and then a multi-table and we'll say I
and you're also going to be able to come

1526
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
and you're also going to be able to come
 

1527
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,110
and you're also going to be able to come
in here and pull values from these using

1528
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
in here and pull values from these using
 

1529
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,830
in here and pull values from these using
exactly the same thing let's say we want

1530
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:10,840
exactly the same thing let's say we want
 

1531
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,590
exactly the same thing let's say we want
to store them as strings two string I

1532
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
to store them as strings two string I
 

1533
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,630
to store them as strings two string I
and then we want to also throw I and J

1534
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
and then we want to also throw I and J
 

1535
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,350
and then we want to also throw I and J
inside of there just for the heck of it

1536
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:18,360
inside of there just for the heck of it
 

1537
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,789
inside of there just for the heck of it
and then we can go end and then finally

1538
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
and then we can go end and then finally
 

1539
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,710
and then we can go end and then finally
end this for Loop now we're going to be

1540
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
end this for Loop now we're going to be
 

1541
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,789
end this for Loop now we're going to be
able to come in and access the values

1542
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
able to come in and access the values
 

1543
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,310
able to come in and access the values
that are stored inside of there of

1544
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320
that are stored inside of there of
 

1545
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,310
that are stored inside of there of
course by using the indexes as well so

1546
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,320
course by using the indexes as well so
 

1547
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,909
course by using the indexes as well so
let's say table and we wanted to get

1548
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
let's say table and we wanted to get
 

1549
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,909
let's say table and we wanted to get
whatever is being stored at the index of

1550
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:34,919
whatever is being stored at the index of
 

1551
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,350
whatever is being stored at the index of
0 0 inside of our multi-dimensional

1552
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
0 0 inside of our multi-dimensional
 

1553
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,029
0 0 inside of our multi-dimensional
array go like this or multi-dimensional

1554
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:40,039
array go like this or multi-dimensional
 

1555
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,070
array go like this or multi-dimensional
table sorry about that and we can get

1556
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,080
table sorry about that and we can get
 

1557
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,029
table sorry about that and we can get
zero and zero like this and you can see

1558
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
zero and zero like this and you can see
 

1559
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,149
zero and zero like this and you can see
it comes back as zero of course we could

1560
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:47,159
it comes back as zero of course we could
 

1561
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,190
it comes back as zero of course we could
come in here and go one and two save

1562
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
come in here and go one and two save
 

1563
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,310
come in here and go one and two save
that and you get one and two right like

1564
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,320
that and you get one and two right like
 

1565
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,630
that and you get one and two right like
that that's how everything is stored

1566
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:52,640
that that's how everything is stored
 

1567
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,430
that that's how everything is stored
inside of the multi-dimensional array

1568
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:54,440
inside of the multi-dimensional array
 

1569
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,990
inside of the multi-dimensional array
and like I said before we're going to

1570
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
and like I said before we're going to
 

1571
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,190
and like I said before we're going to
use pretty much the same exact format

1572
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,200
use pretty much the same exact format
 

1573
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,950
use pretty much the same exact format
for our for loop as you can see right

1574
00:27:59,950 --> 00:27:59,960
for our for loop as you can see right
 

1575
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,430
for our for loop as you can see right
here to cycle through and print out all

1576
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:02,440
here to cycle through and print out all
 

1577
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,909
here to cycle through and print out all
of our items inside of our table make

1578
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:04,919
of our items inside of our table make
 

1579
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,830
of our items inside of our table make
this and you can see that every item is

1580
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:06,840
this and you can see that every item is
 

1581
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,430
this and you can see that every item is
printed out there right there on our

1582
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:08,440
printed out there right there on our
 

1583
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,029
printed out there right there on our
screen and exactly how they are

1584
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:10,039
screen and exactly how they are
 

1585
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:12,190
screen and exactly how they are
formatted go like that and you can see

1586
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,200
formatted go like that and you can see
 

1587
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,149
formatted go like that and you can see
the z0 index so this is the zero index

1588
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:15,159
the z0 index so this is the zero index
 

1589
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:17,909
the z0 index so this is the zero index
for both of them and the 01 and so forth

1590
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
for both of them and the 01 and so forth
 

1591
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,230
for both of them and the 01 and so forth
and so on and you can go through and

1592
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,240
and so on and you can go through and
 

1593
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,190
and so on and you can go through and
play with that and get a little bit more

1594
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
play with that and get a little bit more
 

1595
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,310
play with that and get a little bit more
aware of exactly how tables are set up

1596
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,320
aware of exactly how tables are set up
 

1597
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,710
aware of exactly how tables are set up
inside of Lua and exactly how to use

1598
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:25,720
inside of Lua and exactly how to use
 

1599
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,310
inside of Lua and exactly how to use
them so now let's jump over and take a

1600
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,320
them so now let's jump over and take a
 

1601
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,470
them so now let's jump over and take a
look at function functions okay so a

1602
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:29,480
look at function functions okay so a
 

1603
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,430
look at function functions okay so a
function is going to allow us to reuse

1604
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
function is going to allow us to reuse
 

1605
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,990
function is going to allow us to reuse
our code as well as better organize our

1606
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
our code as well as better organize our
 

1607
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,990
our code as well as better organize our
code and we are going to just create a

1608
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,000
code and we are going to just create a
 

1609
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,990
code and we are going to just create a
function by just typing in function and

1610
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,000
function by just typing in function and
 

1611
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,909
function by just typing in function and
we give it a name like get some

1612
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:39,919
we give it a name like get some
 

1613
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,389
we give it a name like get some
something like that and if you want to

1614
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:41,399
something like that and if you want to
 

1615
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:43,630
something like that and if you want to
pass values into a function to perform

1616
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:43,640
pass values into a function to perform
 

1617
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,110
pass values into a function to perform
operations on them we could do something

1618
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
operations on them we could do something
 

1619
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,430
operations on them we could do something
like number one and number two like that

1620
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
like number one and number two like that
 

1621
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,669
like number one and number two like that
and if you wanted to perform an

1622
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:48,679
and if you wanted to perform an
 

1623
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,870
and if you wanted to perform an
operation and then send it back to

1624
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
operation and then send it back to
 

1625
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,630
operation and then send it back to
whoever called for our function to

1626
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
whoever called for our function to
 

1627
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,389
whoever called for our function to
operate that is exactly how you would do

1628
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:54,399
operate that is exactly how you would do
 

1629
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,549
operate that is exactly how you would do
it and then you would type in end we

1630
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
it and then you would type in end we
 

1631
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,430
it and then you would type in end we
could then come in here and I'm bouncing

1632
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
could then come in here and I'm bouncing
 

1633
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,909
could then come in here and I'm bouncing
back and forth between using print and

1634
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
back and forth between using print and
 

1635
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,149
back and forth between using print and
the right command just to show you how

1636
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
the right command just to show you how
 

1637
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,870
the right command just to show you how
to use them and we could do something

1638
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:05,880
to use them and we could do something
 

1639
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,630
to use them and we could do something
like 5 + 2 is equal to if we want to put

1640
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
like 5 + 2 is equal to if we want to put
 

1641
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,789
like 5 + 2 is equal to if we want to put
a decimal inside of there we just put a

1642
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
a decimal inside of there we just put a
 

1643
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,630
a decimal inside of there we just put a
percent sign and a d like that and then

1644
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:15,640
percent sign and a d like that and then
 

1645
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,669
percent sign and a d like that and then
we would call our function with get sum

1646
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
we would call our function with get sum
 

1647
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,430
we would call our function with get sum
like that and then pass in five and two

1648
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:20,440
like that and then pass in five and two
 

1649
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,070
like that and then pass in five and two
separate with a comma and there you can

1650
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
separate with a comma and there you can
 

1651
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,630
separate with a comma and there you can
see our answer and exactly how we're

1652
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:23,640
see our answer and exactly how we're
 

1653
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,230
see our answer and exactly how we're
able to call that function now let's

1654
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,240
able to call that function now let's
 

1655
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,669
able to call that function now let's
come in and create another function

1656
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:27,679
come in and create another function
 

1657
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,630
come in and create another function
let's have this one called split string

1658
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
let's have this one called split string
 

1659
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,870
let's have this one called split string
and it's going to receive a string

1660
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
and it's going to receive a string
 

1661
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,950
and it's going to receive a string
passed into it we're then going to

1662
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
passed into it we're then going to
 

1663
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,590
passed into it we're then going to
create a string table like this see I

1664
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:38,600
create a string table like this see I
 

1665
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,149
create a string table like this see I
said I'm going to keep coming back to

1666
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
said I'm going to keep coming back to
 

1667
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,870
said I'm going to keep coming back to
all these different things want to

1668
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:41,880
all these different things want to
 

1669
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,669
all these different things want to
define a local variable inside of this

1670
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:44,679
define a local variable inside of this
 

1671
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,110
define a local variable inside of this
and then let's cycle through the string

1672
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,120
and then let's cycle through the string
 

1673
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,509
and then let's cycle through the string
and store anything except for spaces

1674
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:48,519
and store anything except for spaces
 

1675
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,470
and store anything except for spaces
inside of our table how would we do that

1676
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
inside of our table how would we do that
 

1677
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,750
inside of our table how would we do that
well we would go for and our string in

1678
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:53,760
well we would go for and our string in
 

1679
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,830
well we would go for and our string in
and then we would type in string. g

1680
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:56,840
and then we would type in string. g
 

1681
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,389
and then we would type in string. g
match and then pass in the string that

1682
00:29:59,389 --> 00:29:59,399
match and then pass in the string that
 

1683
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,830
match and then pass in the string that
was passed into our function this guy

1684
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,840
was passed into our function this guy
 

1685
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,950
was passed into our function this guy
right here and then if we wanted to

1686
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:03,960
right here and then if we wanted to
 

1687
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,230
right here and then if we wanted to
basically capture all the strings up

1688
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
basically capture all the strings up
 

1689
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,269
basically capture all the strings up
until the point in which there is a

1690
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:08,279
until the point in which there is a
 

1691
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,909
until the point in which there is a
space what we're going to use is a

1692
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:10,919
space what we're going to use is a
 

1693
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,909
space what we're going to use is a
percent sign this is going to represent

1694
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
percent sign this is going to represent
 

1695
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,990
percent sign this is going to represent
the beginning of a string or a bunch of

1696
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
the beginning of a string or a bunch of
 

1697
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,909
the beginning of a string or a bunch of
characters or numbers or whatever that's

1698
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:17,919
characters or numbers or whatever that's
 

1699
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,110
characters or numbers or whatever that's
what this little carrot symbol

1700
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
what this little carrot symbol
 

1701
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,230
what this little carrot symbol
represents and then a percent sign an S

1702
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,240
represents and then a percent sign an S
 

1703
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,230
represents and then a percent sign an S
this is what is known as a regular

1704
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
this is what is known as a regular
 

1705
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,990
this is what is known as a regular
expression I have tutorials on regular

1706
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,000
expression I have tutorials on regular
 

1707
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,549
expression I have tutorials on regular
expressions and I'm probably going to do

1708
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:27,559
expressions and I'm probably going to do
 

1709
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,310
expressions and I'm probably going to do
another one here pretty soon so

1710
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,320
another one here pretty soon so
 

1711
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,750
another one here pretty soon so
basically what we're saying here is we

1712
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:30,760
basically what we're saying here is we
 

1713
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,070
basically what we're saying here is we
want to cycle through the string that

1714
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,080
want to cycle through the string that
 

1715
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,269
want to cycle through the string that
they pass into our function and we want

1716
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:34,279
they pass into our function and we want
 

1717
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,110
they pass into our function and we want
to start capturing characters up until

1718
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,120
to start capturing characters up until
 

1719
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,909
to start capturing characters up until
we reach a space and that is what we are

1720
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
we reach a space and that is what we are
 

1721
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,029
we reach a space and that is what we are
going to be storing inside of our string

1722
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
going to be storing inside of our string
 

1723
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,990
going to be storing inside of our string
table I'm going to see here as we

1724
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,000
table I'm going to see here as we
 

1725
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,549
table I'm going to see here as we
execute it exactly how that's going to

1726
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
execute it exactly how that's going to
 

1727
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,230
execute it exactly how that's going to
work so we're cycling through the string

1728
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
work so we're cycling through the string
 

1729
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,750
work so we're cycling through the string
we're going to go string table and I for

1730
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
we're going to go string table and I for
 

1731
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,230
we're going to go string table and I for
the index for our table and we're going

1732
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
the index for our table and we're going
 

1733
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,549
the index for our table and we're going
to be pulling out each of those strings

1734
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:56,559
to be pulling out each of those strings
 

1735
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,269
to be pulling out each of those strings
and storing them temporarily in a

1736
00:30:58,269 --> 00:30:58,279
and storing them temporarily in a
 

1737
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,269
and storing them temporarily in a
variable named Str Str and then we're

1738
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:00,279
variable named Str Str and then we're
 

1739
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,830
variable named Str Str and then we're
going to save them to our table then all

1740
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
going to save them to our table then all
 

1741
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,789
going to save them to our table then all
we need to do is increment our value for

1742
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
we need to do is increment our value for
 

1743
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,509
we need to do is increment our value for
I and then end okay so we have all of

1744
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:07,519
I and then end okay so we have all of
 

1745
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,629
I and then end okay so we have all of
those set up and now let's also show you

1746
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:09,639
those set up and now let's also show you
 

1747
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:12,389
those set up and now let's also show you
how we can return multiple values from a

1748
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:12,399
how we can return multiple values from a
 

1749
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,590
how we can return multiple values from a
function we would just go return and we

1750
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:14,600
function we would just go return and we
 

1751
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,230
function we would just go return and we
can return our string table which is

1752
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
can return our string table which is
 

1753
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,789
can return our string table which is
going to contain a bunch of values but

1754
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:17,799
going to contain a bunch of values but
 

1755
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,750
going to contain a bunch of values but
then we could also send back the number

1756
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
then we could also send back the number
 

1757
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,669
then we could also send back the number
of matches the total number of words

1758
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:22,679
of matches the total number of words
 

1759
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,470
of matches the total number of words
that we found inside of our string and

1760
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
that we found inside of our string and
 

1761
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,029
that we found inside of our string and
maybe this might make more sense if we

1762
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:26,039
maybe this might make more sense if we
 

1763
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,149
maybe this might make more sense if we
typed in word right here and then and we

1764
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:28,159
typed in word right here and then and we
 

1765
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,350
typed in word right here and then and we
typed in word right here so either way

1766
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,360
typed in word right here so either way
 

1767
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,470
typed in word right here so either way
it works and that's the way it operates

1768
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
it works and that's the way it operates
 

1769
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,230
it works and that's the way it operates
then of course the end or function we

1770
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,240
then of course the end or function we
 

1771
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,590
then of course the end or function we
put end and then we'd be able to return

1772
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:36,600
put end and then we'd be able to return
 

1773
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,549
put end and then we'd be able to return
or receive those multiple values that

1774
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
or receive those multiple values that
 

1775
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,549
or receive those multiple values that
are returned from this function right

1776
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
are returned from this function right
 

1777
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,509
are returned from this function right
here called split string by just going

1778
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:42,519
here called split string by just going
 

1779
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:45,549
here called split string by just going
split let's just say string table so

1780
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:45,559
split let's just say string table so
 

1781
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,470
split let's just say string table so
this value right here is going to be

1782
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:47,480
this value right here is going to be
 

1783
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,830
this value right here is going to be
stored in this guy right here and then

1784
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
stored in this guy right here and then
 

1785
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,710
stored in this guy right here and then
the number of strings inside of there or

1786
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:52,720
the number of strings inside of there or
 

1787
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,110
the number of strings inside of there or
a number of words whatever you want to

1788
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,120
a number of words whatever you want to
 

1789
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,070
a number of words whatever you want to
call it and then we just call our

1790
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,080
call it and then we just call our
 

1791
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,190
call it and then we just call our
function like this and let's just keep

1792
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,200
function like this and let's just keep
 

1793
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,669
function like this and let's just keep
it simple and let's just say something

1794
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
it simple and let's just say something
 

1795
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,590
it simple and let's just say something
like turtle let's just pass in two of

1796
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:01,600
like turtle let's just pass in two of
 

1797
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,269
like turtle let's just pass in two of
those guys we could then come in here

1798
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:04,279
those guys we could then come in here
 

1799
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,470
those guys we could then come in here
and cycle through everything that was

1800
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,480
and cycle through everything that was
 

1801
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,029
and cycle through everything that was
passed back inside of that table go one

1802
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
passed back inside of that table go one
 

1803
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,269
passed back inside of that table go one
again number of strings we're going to

1804
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
again number of strings we're going to
 

1805
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,470
again number of strings we're going to
keep cycling through there this is the

1806
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:13,480
keep cycling through there this is the
 

1807
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,710
keep cycling through there this is the
maximum number of strings and that's the

1808
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:15,720
maximum number of strings and that's the
 

1809
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,590
maximum number of strings and that's the
maximum amount we're going to Loop

1810
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:17,600
maximum amount we're going to Loop
 

1811
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,509
maximum amount we're going to Loop
through two and then we could print out

1812
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
through two and then we could print out
 

1813
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,310
through two and then we could print out
on the STR on the screen let's go and

1814
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
on the STR on the screen let's go and
 

1815
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,710
on the STR on the screen let's go and
format this guy and we can print our

1816
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
format this guy and we can print our
 

1817
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,509
format this guy and we can print our
index separated by the individual words

1818
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:27,519
index separated by the individual words
 

1819
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,430
index separated by the individual words
that we also pass back inside of there

1820
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
that we also pass back inside of there
 

1821
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,590
that we also pass back inside of there
so let's get J and then we'll go split

1822
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:31,600
so let's get J and then we'll go split
 

1823
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,750
so let's get J and then we'll go split
string table this guy right here and

1824
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
string table this guy right here and
 

1825
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,470
string table this guy right here and
then throw the index inside of there

1826
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:35,480
then throw the index inside of there
 

1827
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,629
then throw the index inside of there
then final thing we have to do of course

1828
00:32:37,629 --> 00:32:37,639
then final thing we have to do of course
 

1829
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:40,149
then final thing we have to do of course
is end our for Loop and if you went

1830
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
is end our for Loop and if you went
 

1831
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,789
is end our for Loop and if you went
inside of there you can see that it

1832
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:41,799
inside of there you can see that it
 

1833
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,909
inside of there you can see that it
returned the and turtle and then nil

1834
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:44,919
returned the and turtle and then nil
 

1835
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,990
returned the and turtle and then nil
there's always an extra little nil

1836
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,000
there's always an extra little nil
 

1837
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,590
there's always an extra little nil
inside of there whenever we create

1838
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:48,600
inside of there whenever we create
 

1839
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,710
inside of there whenever we create
tables and we could of course get rid of

1840
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:50,720
tables and we could of course get rid of
 

1841
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,509
tables and we could of course get rid of
that by just going number of string

1842
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:52,519
that by just going number of string
 

1843
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,350
that by just going number of string
minus one and you can see that it just

1844
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:54,360
minus one and you can see that it just
 

1845
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,389
minus one and you can see that it just
prints out the and turtle so that's how

1846
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
prints out the and turtle so that's how
 

1847
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,070
prints out the and turtle so that's how
to go in call A function how to have it

1848
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,080
to go in call A function how to have it
 

1849
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,070
to go in call A function how to have it
return multiple different values how to

1850
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,080
return multiple different values how to
 

1851
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,310
return multiple different values how to
split a string into a table and how to

1852
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
split a string into a table and how to
 

1853
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,750
split a string into a table and how to
return that value over here and save it

1854
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:06,760
return that value over here and save it
 

1855
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,310
return that value over here and save it
into multiple different variables and

1856
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
into multiple different variables and
 

1857
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,789
into multiple different variables and
then cycle through it so there's a whole

1858
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:09,799
then cycle through it so there's a whole
 

1859
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,070
then cycle through it so there's a whole
bunch of different ways we can use

1860
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,080
bunch of different ways we can use
 

1861
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,549
bunch of different ways we can use
functions inside of Lua let's go and

1862
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:13,559
functions inside of Lua let's go and
 

1863
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,389
functions inside of Lua let's go and
talk about vertic functions this is how

1864
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:16,399
talk about vertic functions this is how
 

1865
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,990
talk about vertic functions this is how
we're going to be able to receive an

1866
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000
we're going to be able to receive an
 

1867
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,509
we're going to be able to receive an
unknown number of parameters inside of

1868
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:20,519
unknown number of parameters inside of
 

1869
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,430
unknown number of parameters inside of
our functions again just create a

1870
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:22,440
our functions again just create a
 

1871
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,310
our functions again just create a
function and let's just call this get

1872
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
function and let's just call this get
 

1873
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,750
function and let's just call this get
some more if we don't know how many

1874
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:26,760
some more if we don't know how many
 

1875
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,909
some more if we don't know how many
different parameters or attributes or

1876
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:28,919
different parameters or attributes or
 

1877
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,629
different parameters or attributes or
whatever that could be sent inside here

1878
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:30,639
whatever that could be sent inside here
 

1879
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:31,870
whatever that could be sent inside here
we're just going to put three little

1880
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:31,880
we're just going to put three little
 

1881
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,590
we're just going to put three little
dots inside of there and we can do

1882
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:33,600
dots inside of there and we can do
 

1883
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,590
dots inside of there and we can do
something like local sum is equal to

1884
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:36,600
something like local sum is equal to
 

1885
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,070
something like local sum is equal to
zero we could then come in and go four

1886
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,080
zero we could then come in and go four
 

1887
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,830
zero we could then come in and go four
and this is the key and this is the

1888
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:40,840
and this is the key and this is the
 

1889
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,430
and this is the key and this is the
value once again in pairs this is going

1890
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,440
value once again in pairs this is going
 

1891
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,389
value once again in pairs this is going
to be passed in here as a table then

1892
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:45,399
to be passed in here as a table then
 

1893
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,830
to be passed in here as a table then
we're going to put curly brackets 1 2 3

1894
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
we're going to put curly brackets 1 2 3
 

1895
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,669
we're going to put curly brackets 1 2 3
it's going to automatically just keep

1896
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
it's going to automatically just keep
 

1897
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,590
it's going to automatically just keep
cycling through there depending upon the

1898
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
cycling through there depending upon the
 

1899
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,269
cycling through there depending upon the
number of attributes or parameters that

1900
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:53,279
number of attributes or parameters that
 

1901
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,350
number of attributes or parameters that
were passed inside and we go sum is

1902
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
were passed inside and we go sum is
 

1903
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,990
were passed inside and we go sum is
equal to sum plus whatever value was

1904
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
equal to sum plus whatever value was
 

1905
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,909
equal to sum plus whatever value was
passed inside of course end that with an

1906
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
passed inside of course end that with an
 

1907
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,310
passed inside of course end that with an
end then after it's done go return the

1908
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
end then after it's done go return the
 

1909
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,470
end then after it's done go return the
total sum and then close off the

1910
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
total sum and then close off the
 

1911
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,350
total sum and then close off the
function and then we could print all

1912
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,360
function and then we could print all
 

1913
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,629
function and then we could print all
this out on the screen call get some

1914
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
this out on the screen call get some
 

1915
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,230
this out on the screen call get some
more you're going to be able to pass as

1916
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
more you're going to be able to pass as
 

1917
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,470
more you're going to be able to pass as
many things in here as you could

1918
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:11,480
many things in here as you could
 

1919
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,589
many things in here as you could
possibly ever want to let's just keep it

1920
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599
possibly ever want to let's just keep it
 

1921
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,550
possibly ever want to let's just keep it
as six and it gave me a little bit of an

1922
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:15,560
as six and it gave me a little bit of an
 

1923
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,589
as six and it gave me a little bit of an
error you can see right here get sum I

1924
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:18,599
error you can see right here get sum I
 

1925
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,510
error you can see right here get sum I
can type in some more like that and

1926
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
can type in some more like that and
 

1927
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,710
can type in some more like that and
there we go sum is equal to 21 so that's

1928
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:23,720
there we go sum is equal to 21 so that's
 

1929
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,310
there we go sum is equal to 21 so that's
how we're able to pass in an unknown

1930
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:25,320
how we're able to pass in an unknown
 

1931
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,710
how we're able to pass in an unknown
number of parameters and then use it now

1932
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:27,720
number of parameters and then use it now
 

1933
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,109
number of parameters and then use it now
now another thing is kind of interesting

1934
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:29,119
now another thing is kind of interesting
 

1935
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,270
now another thing is kind of interesting
inside of Lua is a function is a

1936
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
inside of Lua is a function is a
 

1937
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,270
inside of Lua is a function is a
variable in that we can store them under

1938
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:34,280
variable in that we can store them under
 

1939
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,710
variable in that we can store them under
variable names as well as we store

1940
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
variable names as well as we store
 

1941
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,069
variable names as well as we store
tables and we can also pass and return

1942
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:39,079
tables and we can also pass and return
 

1943
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,589
tables and we can also pass and return
them through function so let's

1944
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:40,599
them through function so let's
 

1945
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,750
them through function so let's
demonstrate that let's say double it

1946
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:42,760
demonstrate that let's say double it
 

1947
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,829
demonstrate that let's say double it
there is a variable we can actually put

1948
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:44,839
there is a variable we can actually put
 

1949
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,470
there is a variable we can actually put
a function inside of this so let's say

1950
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:47,480
a function inside of this so let's say
 

1951
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,069
a function inside of this so let's say
it gets a value of x and then we can

1952
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:50,079
it gets a value of x and then we can
 

1953
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,990
it gets a value of x and then we can
just say return x * 2 and then put the N

1954
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
just say return x * 2 and then put the N
 

1955
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,190
just say return x * 2 and then put the N
function on there so we have basically

1956
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,200
function on there so we have basically
 

1957
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,150
function on there so we have basically
just made double it a function it is a

1958
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,160
just made double it a function it is a
 

1959
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,230
just made double it a function it is a
variable also however you can see right

1960
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:01,240
variable also however you can see right
 

1961
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,750
variable also however you can see right
here if we just go print and double it

1962
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:03,760
here if we just go print and double it
 

1963
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,589
here if we just go print and double it
like this and then pass in a four so

1964
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:06,599
like this and then pass in a four so
 

1965
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,310
like this and then pass in a four so
automatically going to pop out an eight

1966
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:08,320
automatically going to pop out an eight
 

1967
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,430
automatically going to pop out an eight
now going along those same lines a

1968
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:10,440
now going along those same lines a
 

1969
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,710
now going along those same lines a
closure is a function that can access

1970
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
closure is a function that can access
 

1971
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,230
closure is a function that can access
local variables of an enclosing function

1972
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,240
local variables of an enclosing function
 

1973
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,990
local variables of an enclosing function
so let's go and let's create one so

1974
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,000
so let's go and let's create one so
 

1975
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,990
so let's go and let's create one so
let's go function let's just call this

1976
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,000
let's go function let's just call this
 

1977
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,950
let's go function let's just call this
outer Funk because this is going to be

1978
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
outer Funk because this is going to be
 

1979
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,230
outer Funk because this is going to be
an outer function that is going to

1980
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:23,240
an outer function that is going to
 

1981
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,150
an outer function that is going to
contain our closure you're going to see

1982
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,160
contain our closure you're going to see
 

1983
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,349
contain our closure you're going to see
exactly why this is interesting so let's

1984
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
exactly why this is interesting so let's
 

1985
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,710
exactly why this is interesting so let's
create a local variable I equal to0 and

1986
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:30,720
create a local variable I equal to0 and
 

1987
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,990
create a local variable I equal to0 and
then let's put an inner function inside

1988
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,000
then let's put an inner function inside
 

1989
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,910
then let's put an inner function inside
of it so return function like this and

1990
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:35,920
of it so return function like this and
 

1991
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,069
of it so return function like this and
then inside of this guy let's go and

1992
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
then inside of this guy let's go and
 

1993
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,310
then inside of this guy let's go and
increment the value of I and then return

1994
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:41,320
increment the value of I and then return
 

1995
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,030
increment the value of I and then return
so this is a function inside of a

1996
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
so this is a function inside of a
 

1997
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,190
so this is a function inside of a
function this is a closure and the

1998
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
function this is a closure and the
 

1999
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,150
function this is a closure and the
reason why it is a closure we have to

2000
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,160
reason why it is a closure we have to
 

2001
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,710
reason why it is a closure we have to
end this and we also have to end this

2002
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:49,720
end this and we also have to end this
 

2003
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,349
end this and we also have to end this
one now whenever you include an inner

2004
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
one now whenever you include an inner
 

2005
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,270
one now whenever you include an inner
function in a function that inner

2006
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,280
function in a function that inner
 

2007
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,829
function in a function that inner
function is actually going to remember

2008
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:55,839
function is actually going to remember
 

2009
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,349
function is actually going to remember
any changes made to the variable inside

2010
00:35:58,349 --> 00:35:58,359
any changes made to the variable inside
 

2011
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,270
any changes made to the variable inside
of the inner function now let's go and

2012
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:00,280
of the inner function now let's go and
 

2013
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,630
of the inner function now let's go and
let's store our function inside of a

2014
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640
let's store our function inside of a
 

2015
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,270
let's store our function inside of a
variable called GI I so we'll go outer

2016
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,280
variable called GI I so we'll go outer
 

2017
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,349
variable called GI I so we'll go outer
Funk like that so there we stored it

2018
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:07,359
Funk like that so there we stored it
 

2019
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,790
Funk like that so there we stored it
inside of there now what we're going to

2020
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:08,800
inside of there now what we're going to
 

2021
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,990
inside of there now what we're going to
be able to do is go print get I like

2022
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
be able to do is go print get I like
 

2023
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,069
be able to do is go print get I like
that and it's a function and then do

2024
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:14,079
that and it's a function and then do
 

2025
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,309
that and it's a function and then do
exactly the same thing again reason why

2026
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:16,319
exactly the same thing again reason why
 

2027
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:18,390
exactly the same thing again reason why
this is a closure is you're going to

2028
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:18,400
this is a closure is you're going to
 

2029
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,910
this is a closure is you're going to
actually continue to increment and store

2030
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:20,920
actually continue to increment and store
 

2031
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,790
actually continue to increment and store
the changing values of I that are inside

2032
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
the changing values of I that are inside
 

2033
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,390
the changing values of I that are inside
of here as you're going to see right

2034
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:24,400
of here as you're going to see right
 

2035
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,910
of here as you're going to see right
here and there you can see value of I is

2036
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:26,920
here and there you can see value of I is
 

2037
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,390
here and there you can see value of I is
is starts off off as one but then

2038
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:29,400
is starts off off as one but then
 

2039
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,790
is starts off off as one but then
whenever it's called a second time it is

2040
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:31,800
whenever it's called a second time it is
 

2041
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,990
whenever it's called a second time it is
going to increment it even though we

2042
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000
going to increment it even though we
 

2043
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,950
going to increment it even though we
assign the value of zero right there so

2044
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
assign the value of zero right there so
 

2045
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,990
assign the value of zero right there so
that's an example of a closure and

2046
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,000
that's an example of a closure and
 

2047
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,950
that's an example of a closure and
exactly how they work and how they store

2048
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:40,960
exactly how they work and how they store
 

2049
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,270
exactly how they work and how they store
values as they are being called multiple

2050
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
values as they are being called multiple
 

2051
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,150
values as they are being called multiple
different times so now let's go and take

2052
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,160
different times so now let's go and take
 

2053
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,230
different times so now let's go and take
a look at a similar thing which is

2054
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,240
a look at a similar thing which is
 

2055
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,390
a look at a similar thing which is
called a co- routine now a co- routine

2056
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,400
called a co- routine now a co- routine
 

2057
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,750
called a co- routine now a co- routine
is very similar to a thread in other

2058
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:51,760
is very similar to a thread in other
 

2059
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,550
is very similar to a thread in other
programming languages except that they

2060
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:54,560
programming languages except that they
 

2061
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,910
programming languages except that they
cannot run in parallel and a co- is

2062
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920
cannot run in parallel and a co- is
 

2063
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,589
cannot run in parallel and a co- is
either going to have a status of running

2064
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
either going to have a status of running
 

2065
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,990
either going to have a status of running
suspended dead or normal and you're

2066
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,000
suspended dead or normal and you're
 

2067
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,390
suspended dead or normal and you're
going to see what all those look like so

2068
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,400
going to see what all those look like so
 

2069
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,190
going to see what all those look like so
let's create a Cod routine how you do

2070
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,200
let's create a Cod routine how you do
 

2071
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,309
let's create a Cod routine how you do
that is by just coming in here and going

2072
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:06,319
that is by just coming in here and going
 

2073
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:09,470
that is by just coming in here and going
Co routine and we're going to say create

2074
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:09,480
Co routine and we're going to say create
 

2075
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,589
Co routine and we're going to say create
and inside of this I'm going to put a

2076
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
and inside of this I'm going to put a
 

2077
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,109
and inside of this I'm going to put a
function and then inside of this I'm

2078
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
function and then inside of this I'm
 

2079
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,950
function and then inside of this I'm
going to say 4 I is equal to 1 give it a

2080
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960
going to say 4 I is equal to 1 give it a
 

2081
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,069
going to say 4 I is equal to 1 give it a
starting value and 10 is going to be the

2082
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:19,079
starting value and 10 is going to be the
 

2083
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,030
starting value and 10 is going to be the
ending value and one is going to be the

2084
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
ending value and one is going to be the
 

2085
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,670
ending value and one is going to be the
increment and then inside of this we're

2086
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:22,680
increment and then inside of this we're
 

2087
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,390
increment and then inside of this we're
going to say print I value of I and also

2088
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:26,400
going to say print I value of I and also
 

2089
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,750
going to say print I value of I and also
let's go print Cod routine status just

2090
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:29,760
let's go print Cod routine status just
 

2091
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,550
let's go print Cod routine status just
so we can see the changing statuses from

2092
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:31,560
so we can see the changing statuses from
 

2093
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,829
so we can see the changing statuses from
running suspended dead or normal how we

2094
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:33,839
running suspended dead or normal how we
 

2095
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,390
running suspended dead or normal how we
do that is pass in COD routine name

2096
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
do that is pass in COD routine name
 

2097
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,349
do that is pass in COD routine name
inside of there close that off and we

2098
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:38,359
inside of there close that off and we
 

2099
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,510
inside of there close that off and we
can say something like if I is equal to

2100
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,520
can say something like if I is equal to
 

2101
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,069
can say something like if I is equal to
5 then and if we want to pause or yield

2102
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
5 then and if we want to pause or yield
 

2103
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,589
5 then and if we want to pause or yield
over to another co- routine we just type

2104
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:48,599
over to another co- routine we just type
 

2105
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,230
over to another co- routine we just type
in co- routine yield and then we're

2106
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,240
in co- routine yield and then we're
 

2107
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,109
in co- routine yield and then we're
going to end our if statement and on the

2108
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
going to end our if statement and on the
 

2109
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,790
going to end our if statement and on the
next line we will end our for Loop and

2110
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:55,800
next line we will end our for Loop and
 

2111
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,870
next line we will end our for Loop and
then on the next line we will end and

2112
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:57,880
then on the next line we will end and
 

2113
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,870
then on the next line we will end and
our Co routine so there we go have all

2114
00:37:59,870 --> 00:37:59,880
our Co routine so there we go have all
 

2115
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,470
our Co routine so there we go have all
those saved maybe it makes a little bit

2116
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:01,480
those saved maybe it makes a little bit
 

2117
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,910
those saved maybe it makes a little bit
more sense come in here and go like this

2118
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:03,920
more sense come in here and go like this
 

2119
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,589
more sense come in here and go like this
and like that now if we want to come in

2120
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:05,599
and like that now if we want to come in
 

2121
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,870
and like that now if we want to come in
here and check our co- routine and see

2122
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:07,880
here and check our co- routine and see
 

2123
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,790
here and check our co- routine and see
what its status is whenever it very

2124
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:09,800
what its status is whenever it very
 

2125
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,109
what its status is whenever it very
first starts we'll just go co- routine

2126
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:12,119
first starts we'll just go co- routine
 

2127
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,950
first starts we'll just go co- routine
status like that and Co exactly like

2128
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
status like that and Co exactly like
 

2129
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,829
status like that and Co exactly like
this and you can see it starts off as

2130
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:16,839
this and you can see it starts off as
 

2131
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,150
this and you can see it starts off as
suspended now we can call for this Co

2132
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,160
suspended now we can call for this Co
 

2133
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,390
suspended now we can call for this Co
routine to resume or start executing and

2134
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,400
routine to resume or start executing and
 

2135
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,470
routine to resume or start executing and
then we can come in here and also check

2136
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480
then we can come in here and also check
 

2137
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,349
then we can come in here and also check
the status after we tell it to start

2138
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:26,359
the status after we tell it to start
 

2139
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:28,150
the status after we tell it to start
running and you can see starts off as

2140
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,160
running and you can see starts off as
 

2141
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,190
running and you can see starts off as
suspended starts coming out here and

2142
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,200
suspended starts coming out here and
 

2143
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,150
suspended starts coming out here and
printing out all these numbers and comes

2144
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,160
printing out all these numbers and comes
 

2145
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,550
printing out all these numbers and comes
right up to five and you can see it's

2146
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:33,560
right up to five and you can see it's
 

2147
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,230
right up to five and you can see it's
also technically running right there

2148
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,240
also technically running right there
 

2149
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,430
also technically running right there
that's the status until it hits five and

2150
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:37,440
that's the status until it hits five and
 

2151
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,710
that's the status until it hits five and
the reason why is it says if I is equal

2152
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:39,720
the reason why is it says if I is equal
 

2153
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,349
the reason why is it says if I is equal
to 5 we want to yield this co- routine

2154
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:42,359
to 5 we want to yield this co- routine
 

2155
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,390
to 5 we want to yield this co- routine
and stop its execution now let's come in

2156
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,400
and stop its execution now let's come in
 

2157
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,430
and stop its execution now let's come in
here and create another code routine

2158
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:46,440
here and create another code routine
 

2159
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,150
here and create another code routine
that we're going to run at the same time

2160
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,160
that we're going to run at the same time
 

2161
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,870
that we're going to run at the same time
very much like we would do with threads

2162
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:49,880
very much like we would do with threads
 

2163
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,990
very much like we would do with threads
it's equal to code routine and we're

2164
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
it's equal to code routine and we're
 

2165
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,910
it's equal to code routine and we're
going to create one and this one's going

2166
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:54,920
going to create one and this one's going
 

2167
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,910
going to create one and this one's going
to go function create a function right

2168
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:56,920
to go function create a function right
 

2169
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,630
to go function create a function right
inside here here create another for Loop

2170
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:58,640
inside here here create another for Loop
 

2171
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,309
inside here here create another for Loop
we go I is equal to 101 can start it off

2172
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:02,319
we go I is equal to 101 can start it off
 

2173
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,950
we go I is equal to 101 can start it off
at 101 and have it count to 110 and

2174
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:04,960
at 101 and have it count to 110 and
 

2175
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,990
at 101 and have it count to 110 and
increment by one and do and print

2176
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,000
increment by one and do and print
 

2177
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,109
increment by one and do and print
whatever the value of I is each time and

2178
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:10,119
whatever the value of I is each time and
 

2179
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,910
whatever the value of I is each time and
then end our for loop as well as end our

2180
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:12,920
then end our for loop as well as end our
 

2181
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,829
then end our for loop as well as end our
code routine and now we can see that if

2182
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:14,839
code routine and now we can see that if
 

2183
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:17,670
code routine and now we can see that if
we go in here again and go code routine

2184
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:17,680
we go in here again and go code routine
 

2185
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,150
we go in here again and go code routine
resume like this let's just have this be

2186
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160
resume like this let's just have this be
 

2187
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,190
resume like this let's just have this be
CO2 like that but then also do exactly

2188
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,200
CO2 like that but then also do exactly
 

2189
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,950
CO2 like that but then also do exactly
the same thing or restart or continue

2190
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:25,960
the same thing or restart or continue
 

2191
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,190
the same thing or restart or continue
execution inside of our original code

2192
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,200
execution inside of our original code
 

2193
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,069
execution inside of our original code
routine that we created and you can see

2194
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
routine that we created and you can see
 

2195
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,109
routine that we created and you can see
the process here starts off as suspended

2196
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:32,119
the process here starts off as suspended
 

2197
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,589
the process here starts off as suspended
gets up to five running then it gets

2198
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:34,599
gets up to five running then it gets
 

2199
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,910
gets up to five running then it gets
suspended jumps over to the other co-

2200
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:36,920
suspended jumps over to the other co-
 

2201
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,109
suspended jumps over to the other co-
routine which doesn't get suspended or

2202
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
routine which doesn't get suspended or
 

2203
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,990
routine which doesn't get suspended or
doesn't have to yield its time at all

2204
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,000
doesn't have to yield its time at all
 

2205
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,109
doesn't have to yield its time at all
goes through its entire process and then

2206
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:43,119
goes through its entire process and then
 

2207
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,670
goes through its entire process and then
whenever we call the code routine to

2208
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:44,680
whenever we call the code routine to
 

2209
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,750
whenever we call the code routine to
continue execution you can see that it

2210
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:46,760
continue execution you can see that it
 

2211
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,069
continue execution you can see that it
continues executing until it is finally

2212
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:49,079
continues executing until it is finally
 

2213
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,829
continues executing until it is finally
dead and you can see right here if we

2214
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:50,839
dead and you can see right here if we
 

2215
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,030
dead and you can see right here if we
come in and get the status of this code

2216
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,040
come in and get the status of this code
 

2217
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,589
come in and get the status of this code
routine right here it is in fact dead

2218
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:55,599
routine right here it is in fact dead
 

2219
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,670
routine right here it is in fact dead
after it has done or executed all the

2220
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:57,680
after it has done or executed all the
 

2221
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,670
after it has done or executed all the
code inside of it so there's an overview

2222
00:39:59,670 --> 00:39:59,680
code inside of it so there's an overview
 

2223
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,990
code inside of it so there's an overview
of cod routines now let's take a look at

2224
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,000
of cod routines now let's take a look at
 

2225
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,470
of cod routines now let's take a look at
something that a lot of people are

2226
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:03,480
something that a lot of people are
 

2227
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,510
something that a lot of people are
confused about because there's not much

2228
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:05,520
confused about because there's not much
 

2229
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,670
confused about because there's not much
good information online about it and

2230
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:07,680
good information online about it and
 

2231
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,109
good information online about it and
that is file IO now there's many

2232
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:10,119
that is file IO now there's many
 

2233
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,349
that is file IO now there's many
different ways that we're going to be

2234
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
different ways that we're going to be
 

2235
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,790
different ways that we're going to be
able to operate on files and you can see

2236
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:13,800
able to operate on files and you can see
 

2237
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,510
able to operate on files and you can see
all the different ways right here we're

2238
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,520
all the different ways right here we're
 

2239
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,430
all the different ways right here we're
going to either be able to have the file

2240
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
going to either be able to have the file
 

2241
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,710
going to either be able to have the file
set as readon which is the default we're

2242
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:19,720
set as readon which is the default we're
 

2243
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,710
set as readon which is the default we're
going to either overwrite or create a

2244
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:21,720
going to either overwrite or create a
 

2245
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,910
going to either overwrite or create a
new file a which means we're going to

2246
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:23,920
new file a which means we're going to
 

2247
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,309
new file a which means we're going to
append or create a new file if this is

2248
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:26,319
append or create a new file if this is
 

2249
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,470
append or create a new file if this is
used this is used for for read and write

2250
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:28,480
used this is used for for read and write
 

2251
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,030
used this is used for for read and write
of an existing file overwrite read or

2252
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
of an existing file overwrite read or
 

2253
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,390
of an existing file overwrite read or
create a new file and then append read

2254
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:33,400
create a new file and then append read
 

2255
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,030
create a new file and then append read
or create a new file I'm going to come

2256
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,040
or create a new file I'm going to come
 

2257
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,589
or create a new file I'm going to come
in here and actually start opening files

2258
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:37,599
in here and actually start opening files
 

2259
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,470
in here and actually start opening files
and storing things inside of them so we

2260
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:39,480
and storing things inside of them so we
 

2261
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,589
and storing things inside of them so we
can see exactly how this operates if we

2262
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
can see exactly how this operates if we
 

2263
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,950
can see exactly how this operates if we
want to create a new file that we're

2264
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
want to create a new file that we're
 

2265
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,270
want to create a new file that we're
going to be working with we just go IO

2266
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,280
going to be working with we just go IO
 

2267
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,109
going to be working with we just go IO
open right like this and then we're

2268
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
open right like this and then we're
 

2269
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,470
open right like this and then we're
going to give it a name let's say I'd

2270
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:48,480
going to give it a name let's say I'd
 

2271
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,470
going to give it a name let's say I'd
call this test Lua like that and let's

2272
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:51,480
call this test Lua like that and let's
 

2273
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,230
call this test Lua like that and let's
say that I want to have the opportunity

2274
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:53,240
say that I want to have the opportunity
 

2275
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,870
say that I want to have the opportunity
to create a new file CU I know this

2276
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:54,880
to create a new file CU I know this
 

2277
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,670
to create a new file CU I know this
doesn't exist right now and then I want

2278
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:56,680
doesn't exist right now and then I want
 

2279
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,870
doesn't exist right now and then I want
to also be able to overwrite and read

2280
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880
to also be able to overwrite and read
 

2281
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,670
to also be able to overwrite and read
from that file so I'm going to just use

2282
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:00,680
from that file so I'm going to just use
 

2283
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,190
from that file so I'm going to just use
that guy right there cuz that works for

2284
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:02,200
that guy right there cuz that works for
 

2285
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,550
that guy right there cuz that works for
all the things I want to be able to do

2286
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:03,560
all the things I want to be able to do
 

2287
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,390
all the things I want to be able to do
and there you go you just created a file

2288
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:05,400
and there you go you just created a file
 

2289
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,309
and there you go you just created a file
and you're able to write to it and read

2290
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:07,319
and you're able to write to it and read
 

2291
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:09,510
and you're able to write to it and read
from it and also make it now if we want

2292
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
from it and also make it now if we want
 

2293
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,030
from it and also make it now if we want
to come in here and write some text to

2294
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:12,040
to come in here and write some text to
 

2295
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,230
to come in here and write some text to
the file we just go file write and then

2296
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,240
the file we just go file write and then
 

2297
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,870
the file we just go file write and then
we'll say random string of text and we

2298
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:17,880
we'll say random string of text and we
 

2299
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,710
we'll say random string of text and we
can use new lines inside of here for our

2300
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:19,720
can use new lines inside of here for our
 

2301
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,790
can use new lines inside of here for our
files as well and let's say we want to

2302
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:21,800
files as well and let's say we want to
 

2303
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,349
files as well and let's say we want to
put some more stuff in there so we'll

2304
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:23,359
put some more stuff in there so we'll
 

2305
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,550
put some more stuff in there so we'll
say write again and we'll just say

2306
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:25,560
say write again and we'll just say
 

2307
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,870
say write again and we'll just say
something like some more

2308
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:27,880
something like some more
 

2309
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,870
something like some more
text throw another new line inside of

2310
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:29,880
text throw another new line inside of
 

2311
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,150
text throw another new line inside of
there we can use seek now to move back

2312
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,160
there we can use seek now to move back
 

2313
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,190
there we can use seek now to move back
to the beginning of our file by going

2314
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,200
to the beginning of our file by going
 

2315
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,430
to the beginning of our file by going
file seek like this and then we're going

2316
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:36,440
file seek like this and then we're going
 

2317
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,510
file seek like this and then we're going
to type in set and then the index where

2318
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
to type in set and then the index where
 

2319
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,510
to type in set and then the index where
we want to jump because everything is

2320
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
we want to jump because everything is
 

2321
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,190
we want to jump because everything is
indexes inside of string so we want to

2322
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200
indexes inside of string so we want to
 

2323
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,550
indexes inside of string so we want to
jump back to the beginning of our file

2324
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:44,560
jump back to the beginning of our file
 

2325
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,270
jump back to the beginning of our file
and that's how we do that and then if we

2326
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:46,280
and that's how we do that and then if we
 

2327
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,109
and that's how we do that and then if we
want to go and read everything from our

2328
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:49,119
want to go and read everything from our
 

2329
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,829
want to go and read everything from our
file we'll just go file read right like

2330
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
file we'll just go file read right like
 

2331
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,790
file we'll just go file read right like
this and then we'll put a star inside of

2332
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:53,800
this and then we'll put a star inside of
 

2333
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,630
this and then we'll put a star inside of
here and an a meaning that we want to

2334
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:55,640
here and an a meaning that we want to
 

2335
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,670
here and an a meaning that we want to
read everything from our file okay so we

2336
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680
read everything from our file okay so we
 

2337
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,829
read everything from our file okay so we
wrote to our file we created our file we

2338
00:41:59,829 --> 00:41:59,839
wrote to our file we created our file we
 

2339
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,510
wrote to our file we created our file we
jump back to the beginning of our file

2340
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:01,520
jump back to the beginning of our file
 

2341
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,190
jump back to the beginning of our file
and we're going to read everything from

2342
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,200
and we're going to read everything from
 

2343
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,309
and we're going to read everything from
that point final thing we need to do is

2344
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:05,319
that point final thing we need to do is
 

2345
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:07,390
that point final thing we need to do is
close our file and there we go and it

2346
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:07,400
close our file and there we go and it
 

2347
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,910
close our file and there we go and it
popped up a little bit of an error I

2348
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:08,920
popped up a little bit of an error I
 

2349
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,710
popped up a little bit of an error I
keep the errors inside here just want to

2350
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,720
keep the errors inside here just want to
 

2351
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,230
keep the errors inside here just want to
make sure we put our quotes inside of

2352
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
make sure we put our quotes inside of
 

2353
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,470
make sure we put our quotes inside of
there because I think whenever you see

2354
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:13,480
there because I think whenever you see
 

2355
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,990
there because I think whenever you see
me make an error that's going to help

2356
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,000
me make an error that's going to help
 

2357
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,829
me make an error that's going to help
you keep from making errors and you can

2358
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:16,839
you keep from making errors and you can
 

2359
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,349
you keep from making errors and you can
see right there printed out random

2360
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:18,359
see right there printed out random
 

2361
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,470
see right there printed out random
string of text and some more text right

2362
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
string of text and some more text right
 

2363
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,870
string of text and some more text right
like that now let's say that we wanted

2364
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:21,880
like that now let's say that we wanted
 

2365
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,990
like that now let's say that we wanted
to come in here and also continue

2366
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
to come in here and also continue
 

2367
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,790
to come in here and also continue
working with our file but we want to

2368
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:25,800
working with our file but we want to
 

2369
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,589
working with our file but we want to
append data to the end of our file how

2370
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:28,599
append data to the end of our file how
 

2371
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,430
append data to the end of our file how
do we do that well we can just leave

2372
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:30,440
do we do that well we can just leave
 

2373
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,910
do we do that well we can just leave
this named as file because Lua is real

2374
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:32,920
this named as file because Lua is real
 

2375
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,549
this named as file because Lua is real
nice about stuff like that and we'll

2376
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:34,559
nice about stuff like that and we'll
 

2377
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,069
nice about stuff like that and we'll
just say IO open and again we're just

2378
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:37,079
just say IO open and again we're just
 

2379
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,750
just say IO open and again we're just
going to type in the name of the file

2380
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:38,760
going to type in the name of the file
 

2381
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,190
going to type in the name of the file
that we want to work with and then in

2382
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,200
that we want to work with and then in
 

2383
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,309
that we want to work with and then in
this situation I want to append so I'm

2384
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
this situation I want to append so I'm
 

2385
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,790
this situation I want to append so I'm
going to say A+ like that I can of

2386
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
going to say A+ like that I can of
 

2387
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,230
going to say A+ like that I can of
course come in and write some new

2388
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:47,240
course come in and write some new
 

2389
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,710
course come in and write some new
information to our file and let's just

2390
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:49,720
information to our file and let's just
 

2391
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,150
information to our file and let's just
say even more text again remember you if

2392
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,160
say even more text again remember you if
 

2393
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,710
say even more text again remember you if
you want to read from a file you have to

2394
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
you want to read from a file you have to
 

2395
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,349
you want to read from a file you have to
jump back to the beginning of it so

2396
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:56,359
jump back to the beginning of it so
 

2397
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:58,430
jump back to the beginning of it so
we're going to use seek to do that and

2398
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:58,440
we're going to use seek to do that and
 

2399
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,230
we're going to use seek to do that and
we're going to say set and then we're

2400
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,240
we're going to say set and then we're
 

2401
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,829
we're going to say set and then we're
going to say exactly where we want to

2402
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:01,839
going to say exactly where we want to
 

2403
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,390
going to say exactly where we want to
jump to you can put any index in here to

2404
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:04,400
jump to you can put any index in here to
 

2405
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,549
jump to you can put any index in here to
jump around all over inside of the file

2406
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:06,559
jump around all over inside of the file
 

2407
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:08,990
jump around all over inside of the file
and then we can say print and of course

2408
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:09,000
and then we can say print and of course
 

2409
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,750
and then we can say print and of course
we're going to read data from our file

2410
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
we're going to read data from our file
 

2411
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,190
we're going to read data from our file
and we want to get all of that data

2412
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,200
and we want to get all of that data
 

2413
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,470
and we want to get all of that data
inside of there right like this and then

2414
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,480
inside of there right like this and then
 

2415
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,750
inside of there right like this and then
finally we want to close our file and if

2416
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:18,760
finally we want to close our file and if
 

2417
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,710
finally we want to close our file and if
we do all that you can see random string

2418
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:20,720
we do all that you can see random string
 

2419
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,069
we do all that you can see random string
text and then some more text comes in

2420
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:23,079
text and then some more text comes in
 

2421
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:24,990
text and then some more text comes in
there and then even more text gets

2422
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,000
there and then even more text gets
 

2423
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,829
there and then even more text gets
printed out on our screen so that is how

2424
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:26,839
printed out on our screen so that is how
 

2425
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,349
printed out on our screen so that is how
we're going to be able to work with our

2426
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
we're going to be able to work with our
 

2427
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,710
we're going to be able to work with our
files inside of Lua now let's take a

2428
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:32,720
files inside of Lua now let's take a
 

2429
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,790
files inside of Lua now let's take a
look at modules okay so basically a

2430
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:35,800
look at modules okay so basically a
 

2431
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,309
look at modules okay so basically a
module is like a library that is full of

2432
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
module is like a library that is full of
 

2433
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,510
module is like a library that is full of
functions and variables and you're going

2434
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:40,520
functions and variables and you're going
 

2435
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,870
functions and variables and you're going
to be able to create it and then use it

2436
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:42,880
to be able to create it and then use it
 

2437
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,910
to be able to create it and then use it
inside of your program so let's go and

2438
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:44,920
inside of your program so let's go and
 

2439
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,030
inside of your program so let's go and
let's create a module so we'll just come

2440
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,040
let's create a module so we'll just come
 

2441
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,069
let's create a module so we'll just come
in here and go new file and I am going

2442
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079
in here and go new file and I am going
 

2443
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,349
in here and go new file and I am going
to save this guy using the name convert.

2444
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:54,359
to save this guy using the name convert.
 

2445
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,710
to save this guy using the name convert.
Lua of course and then save that so

2446
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:56,720
Lua of course and then save that so
 

2447
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,470
Lua of course and then save that so
let's create create a module it's very

2448
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
let's create create a module it's very
 

2449
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,030
let's create create a module it's very
important that your module name and your

2450
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,040
important that your module name and your
 

2451
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,069
important that your module name and your
file name are exactly the same and to

2452
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
file name are exactly the same and to
 

2453
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,390
file name are exactly the same and to
create one I'm going to go local convert

2454
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
create one I'm going to go local convert
 

2455
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,589
create one I'm going to go local convert
the name of this guy and there is our

2456
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:06,599
the name of this guy and there is our
 

2457
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,470
the name of this guy and there is our
module and then inside of this I can put

2458
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:08,480
module and then inside of this I can put
 

2459
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,510
module and then inside of this I can put
a function let's say I want to do

2460
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:10,520
a function let's say I want to do
 

2461
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,510
a function let's say I want to do
something like convert feet to

2462
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:12,520
something like convert feet to
 

2463
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,150
something like convert feet to
centimeters so we'll go Feet 2 cm and

2464
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160
centimeters so we'll go Feet 2 cm and
 

2465
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,309
centimeters so we'll go Feet 2 cm and
this function is going to receive an

2466
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:18,319
this function is going to receive an
 

2467
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,510
this function is going to receive an
attribute of feet and then it is going

2468
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:20,520
attribute of feet and then it is going
 

2469
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,470
attribute of feet and then it is going
to return whatever that value is times

2470
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480
to return whatever that value is times
 

2471
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,870
to return whatever that value is times
30.48 I think that's right and n and and

2472
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:27,880
30.48 I think that's right and n and and
 

2473
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,790
30.48 I think that's right and n and and
then you also need to return the module

2474
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:30,800
then you also need to return the module
 

2475
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,230
then you also need to return the module
and save it and that is how we're going

2476
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
and save it and that is how we're going
 

2477
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,950
and save it and that is how we're going
to do it just make sure we have convert

2478
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:33,960
to do it just make sure we have convert
 

2479
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,470
to do it just make sure we have convert
here convert here and convert here very

2480
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
here convert here and convert here very
 

2481
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,030
here convert here and convert here very
important and also the name of the file

2482
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:38,040
important and also the name of the file
 

2483
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,069
important and also the name of the file
has to be converted or convert well now

2484
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079
has to be converted or convert well now
 

2485
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,230
has to be converted or convert well now
we can come over and do something like

2486
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,240
we can come over and do something like
 

2487
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,309
we can come over and do something like
convert module doesn't need to be named

2488
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:44,319
convert module doesn't need to be named
 

2489
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,270
convert module doesn't need to be named
convert module name it whatever you want

2490
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:46,280
convert module name it whatever you want
 

2491
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,750
convert module name it whatever you want
and if you want to be able to get access

2492
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
and if you want to be able to get access
 

2493
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,950
and if you want to be able to get access
to that they have to be in the same

2494
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
to that they have to be in the same
 

2495
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,470
to that they have to be in the same
directory of course we're going to say

2496
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:50,480
directory of course we're going to say
 

2497
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,309
directory of course we're going to say
require and convert right like this and

2498
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:53,319
require and convert right like this and
 

2499
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:54,950
require and convert right like this and
then we'll be able to come in here and

2500
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,960
then we'll be able to come in here and
 

2501
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,790
then we'll be able to come in here and
work with this module function this this

2502
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:57,800
work with this module function this this
 

2503
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,870
work with this module function this this
and let's say that we want only three

2504
00:44:59,870 --> 00:44:59,880
and let's say that we want only three
 

2505
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,790
and let's say that we want only three
decimal places that's how we do that

2506
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:01,800
decimal places that's how we do that
 

2507
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,349
decimal places that's how we do that
with a floating Point number and there

2508
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
with a floating Point number and there
 

2509
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,910
with a floating Point number and there
is centimet and then if we want to call

2510
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
is centimet and then if we want to call
 

2511
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,630
is centimet and then if we want to call
our module just convert module just like

2512
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,640
our module just convert module just like
 

2513
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,270
our module just convert module just like
we created right there and then follow

2514
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:10,280
we created right there and then follow
 

2515
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,270
we created right there and then follow
that with feet to CM which is the name

2516
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
that with feet to CM which is the name
 

2517
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,150
that with feet to CM which is the name
of the function we have in the module

2518
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:15,160
of the function we have in the module
 

2519
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,109
of the function we have in the module
and we can pass in a value of 12 and you

2520
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:17,119
and we can pass in a value of 12 and you
 

2521
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,549
and we can pass in a value of 12 and you
can see it gets back the answer of

2522
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:19,559
can see it gets back the answer of
 

2523
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,349
can see it gets back the answer of
42.4 CM so there's a quick example of

2524
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
42.4 CM so there's a quick example of
 

2525
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,270
42.4 CM so there's a quick example of
how we can work with modules inside of

2526
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:26,280
how we can work with modules inside of
 

2527
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,750
how we can work with modules inside of
Lua now let's take a look at meta

2528
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:28,760
Lua now let's take a look at meta
 

2529
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,390
Lua now let's take a look at meta
tables now a meta table is going to

2530
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:31,400
tables now a meta table is going to
 

2531
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,710
tables now a meta table is going to
allow us to Define how operations on

2532
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:33,720
allow us to Define how operations on
 

2533
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,910
allow us to Define how operations on
tables should be carried out in regards

2534
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:35,920
tables should be carried out in regards
 

2535
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,349
tables should be carried out in regards
to adding tables together subtracting

2536
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:38,359
to adding tables together subtracting
 

2537
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,549
to adding tables together subtracting
multiplying dividing concatenating

2538
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:40,559
multiplying dividing concatenating
 

2539
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:42,430
multiplying dividing concatenating
comparing tables and so forth and so on

2540
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:42,440
comparing tables and so forth and so on
 

2541
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,270
comparing tables and so forth and so on
so let's come in and create a table and

2542
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:44,280
so let's come in and create a table and
 

2543
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,950
so let's come in and create a table and
put some default values in it so I'm

2544
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:45,960
put some default values in it so I'm
 

2545
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,790
put some default values in it so I'm
just going to go a table like this and

2546
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:48,800
just going to go a table like this and
 

2547
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,349
just going to go a table like this and
create my little table and then I'm

2548
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:50,359
create my little table and then I'm
 

2549
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:52,390
create my little table and then I'm
going to use a for Loop to jump through

2550
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,400
going to use a for Loop to jump through
 

2551
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,630
going to use a for Loop to jump through
here and just fill it up with stuff

2552
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:54,640
here and just fill it up with stuff
 

2553
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,270
here and just fill it up with stuff
let's just say 1 through 10 two and and

2554
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:57,280
let's just say 1 through 10 two and and
 

2555
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,510
let's just say 1 through 10 two and and
a table and of course we're going to use

2556
00:45:59,510 --> 00:45:59,520
a table and of course we're going to use
 

2557
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,990
a table and of course we're going to use
the same indexes here and just store

2558
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,000
the same indexes here and just store
 

2559
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,109
the same indexes here and just store
whatever the value is inside of there of

2560
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:04,119
whatever the value is inside of there of
 

2561
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:05,870
whatever the value is inside of there of
course close that off so there we go we

2562
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:05,880
course close that off so there we go we
 

2563
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,870
course close that off so there we go we
got a table now we're going to Define

2564
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:07,880
got a table now we're going to Define
 

2565
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,870
got a table now we're going to Define
our meta table and how we're going to do

2566
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:09,880
our meta table and how we're going to do
 

2567
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,670
our meta table and how we're going to do
this is go Mt and then we're going to

2568
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
this is go Mt and then we're going to
 

2569
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,750
this is go Mt and then we're going to
Define how table values should be added

2570
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:14,760
Define how table values should be added
 

2571
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,430
Define how table values should be added
and you're going to be able to Define

2572
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:16,440
and you're going to be able to Define
 

2573
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,470
and you're going to be able to Define
like I said before adding you're going

2574
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,480
like I said before adding you're going
 

2575
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,510
like I said before adding you're going
to be able to also Define how table

2576
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:20,520
to be able to also Define how table
 

2577
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,750
to be able to also Define how table
should be subtracted how they should be

2578
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:22,760
should be subtracted how they should be
 

2579
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,950
should be subtracted how they should be
multiplied how they should be divided

2580
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:25,960
multiplied how they should be divided
 

2581
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,670
multiplied how they should be divided
how they should be if you want to use

2582
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:27,680
how they should be if you want to use
 

2583
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,710
how they should be if you want to use
the modulus and how they should be

2584
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
the modulus and how they should be
 

2585
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,470
the modulus and how they should be
combined which is the same as this guy

2586
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:33,480
combined which is the same as this guy
 

2587
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,630
combined which is the same as this guy
right here which we've talked about

2588
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:34,640
right here which we've talked about
 

2589
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,470
right here which we've talked about
previously I'm just going to focus on a

2590
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
previously I'm just going to focus on a
 

2591
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,710
previously I'm just going to focus on a
couple of these so I'm going to go add

2592
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720
couple of these so I'm going to go add
 

2593
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,630
couple of these so I'm going to go add
there's two spaces right here by the way

2594
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:40,640
there's two spaces right here by the way
 

2595
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,150
there's two spaces right here by the way
there's two underscores all right so

2596
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:43,160
there's two underscores all right so
 

2597
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,589
there's two underscores all right so
we're going to Define how these are

2598
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:44,599
we're going to Define how these are
 

2599
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:46,430
we're going to Define how these are
going to be added together we're going

2600
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:46,440
going to be added together we're going
 

2601
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,470
going to be added together we're going
to go function and we're going to say if

2602
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:48,480
to go function and we're going to say if
 

2603
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,390
to go function and we're going to say if
you pass in table one two tables I'm

2604
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:51,400
you pass in table one two tables I'm
 

2605
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,230
you pass in table one two tables I'm
going to Define here exactly how they

2606
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:53,240
going to Define here exactly how they
 

2607
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,270
going to Define here exactly how they
are going to be added together I'm going

2608
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
are going to be added together I'm going
 

2609
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,030
are going to be added together I'm going
to create a sum table like this which is

2610
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:58,040
to create a sum table like this which is
 

2611
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,549
to create a sum table like this which is
going to be the table that is going to

2612
00:46:59,549 --> 00:46:59,559
going to be the table that is going to
 

2613
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:02,950
going to be the table that is going to
be returned and I'm going to go 4 Y is

2614
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
be returned and I'm going to go 4 Y is
 

2615
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,990
be returned and I'm going to go 4 Y is
equal to 1 and I'm going to cycle

2616
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,000
equal to 1 and I'm going to cycle
 

2617
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,750
equal to 1 and I'm going to cycle
through the number of tables that we

2618
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:07,760
through the number of tables that we
 

2619
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,390
through the number of tables that we
have right here and just do that for me

2620
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,400
have right here and just do that for me
 

2621
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,950
have right here and just do that for me
and then let's say that I want to also

2622
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:11,960
and then let's say that I want to also
 

2623
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,470
and then let's say that I want to also
come in here and check to make sure that

2624
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:14,480
come in here and check to make sure that
 

2625
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,230
come in here and check to make sure that
the table values are not equal to nil

2626
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:17,240
the table values are not equal to nil
 

2627
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,030
the table values are not equal to nil
well I can just go table one like that

2628
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:20,040
well I can just go table one like that
 

2629
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,349
well I can just go table one like that
and get the value of that is remember

2630
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:22,359
and get the value of that is remember
 

2631
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:25,430
and get the value of that is remember
it's not it's the Tilt sign not equal to

2632
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,440
it's not it's the Tilt sign not equal to
 

2633
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,630
it's not it's the Tilt sign not equal to
nil can do that and both of these have

2634
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
nil can do that and both of these have
 

2635
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,549
nil can do that and both of these have
to be true for this to work I can say

2636
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:30,559
to be true for this to work I can say
 

2637
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,030
to be true for this to work I can say
table two and then also put the Y inside

2638
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:34,040
table two and then also put the Y inside
 

2639
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,309
table two and then also put the Y inside
of there not equal to nil well then I

2640
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:38,319
of there not equal to nil well then I
 

2641
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,470
of there not equal to nil well then I
will do some stuff well make sure that

2642
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:40,480
will do some stuff well make sure that
 

2643
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,349
will do some stuff well make sure that
we put this guy over here close that off

2644
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:43,359
we put this guy over here close that off
 

2645
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,510
we put this guy over here close that off
and then put then there we are open this

2646
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:45,520
and then put then there we are open this
 

2647
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,950
and then put then there we are open this
up a little bit better what am I going

2648
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:46,960
up a little bit better what am I going
 

2649
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,109
up a little bit better what am I going
to do if I got what I need here well I'm

2650
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:50,119
to do if I got what I need here well I'm
 

2651
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:51,870
to do if I got what I need here well I'm
going to start adding stuff to the sum

2652
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:51,880
going to start adding stuff to the sum
 

2653
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,630
going to start adding stuff to the sum
table so sum table the value is going to

2654
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:54,640
table so sum table the value is going to
 

2655
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,870
table so sum table the value is going to
be stored inside of the same exact index

2656
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
be stored inside of the same exact index
 

2657
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,829
be stored inside of the same exact index
is going to be equal to and this is just

2658
00:47:58,829 --> 00:47:58,839
is going to be equal to and this is just
 

2659
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:01,870
is going to be equal to and this is just
what I decided how I want to you can

2660
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:01,880
what I decided how I want to you can
 

2661
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,030
what I decided how I want to you can
decide how you want to add table values

2662
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
decide how you want to add table values
 

2663
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,870
decide how you want to add table values
anyway but this is the way that makes

2664
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:06,880
anyway but this is the way that makes
 

2665
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,270
anyway but this is the way that makes
logical sense to me so table two so I'm

2666
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
logical sense to me so table two so I'm
 

2667
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,950
logical sense to me so table two so I'm
going to take the values that's in one

2668
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,960
going to take the values that's in one
 

2669
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,190
going to take the values that's in one
and two and then store them inside of a

2670
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
and two and then store them inside of a
 

2671
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,430
and two and then store them inside of a
brand new table this guy right here else

2672
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:16,440
brand new table this guy right here else
 

2673
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,270
brand new table this guy right here else
let's say that one of these came back as

2674
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:18,280
let's say that one of these came back as
 

2675
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,710
let's say that one of these came back as
nil what do I want to do in that

2676
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:19,720
nil what do I want to do in that
 

2677
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,950
nil what do I want to do in that
situation well I want to say Su table Y

2678
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
situation well I want to say Su table Y
 

2679
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,589
situation well I want to say Su table Y
and let's say that I want to store zero

2680
00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:24,599
and let's say that I want to store zero
 

2681
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,230
and let's say that I want to store zero
inside of there I make the rules in this

2682
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
inside of there I make the rules in this
 

2683
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,950
inside of there I make the rules in this
situation so that's how it's going to

2684
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:27,960
situation so that's how it's going to
 

2685
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,630
situation so that's how it's going to
work because that's how I decided it'll

2686
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:29,640
work because that's how I decided it'll
 

2687
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,510
work because that's how I decided it'll
work and we want to close off our if

2688
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
work and we want to close off our if
 

2689
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,950
work and we want to close off our if
statement and we want to close off our

2690
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:32,960
statement and we want to close off our
 

2691
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,390
statement and we want to close off our
four statement and then after we have

2692
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:35,400
four statement and then after we have
 

2693
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,270
four statement and then after we have
created our brand new table with all

2694
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,280
created our brand new table with all
 

2695
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,470
created our brand new table with all
those sums inside of it I want to return

2696
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:39,480
those sums inside of it I want to return
 

2697
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,710
those sums inside of it I want to return
that guy right there and then I want to

2698
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:41,720
that guy right there and then I want to
 

2699
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,390
that guy right there and then I want to
end this I'm going to say end and I'm

2700
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
end this I'm going to say end and I'm
 

2701
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,270
end this I'm going to say end and I'm
going to put a comma right after that

2702
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:46,280
going to put a comma right after that
 

2703
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,990
going to put a comma right after that
now I can also come in here and Define

2704
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
now I can also come in here and Define
 

2705
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,510
now I can also come in here and Define
how table values are going to be checked

2706
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
how table values are going to be checked
 

2707
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,150
how table values are going to be checked
for equality and how we can do that is

2708
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,160
for equality and how we can do that is
 

2709
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,549
for equality and how we can do that is
to underscores again put EQ inside there

2710
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:55,559
to underscores again put EQ inside there
 

2711
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:57,309
to underscores again put EQ inside there
is equal to fun

2712
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:57,319
is equal to fun
 

2713
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:00,589
is equal to fun
and I can go table one and table two

2714
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:00,599
and I can go table one and table two
 

2715
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,470
and I can go table one and table two
like this and then I can just go return

2716
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:03,480
like this and then I can just go return
 

2717
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,549
like this and then I can just go return
table one get the value inside of it and

2718
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:06,559
table one get the value inside of it and
 

2719
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,670
table one get the value inside of it and
make sure that it is equal to table two

2720
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:09,680
make sure that it is equal to table two
 

2721
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,589
make sure that it is equal to table two
and get the value out of that as well

2722
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:11,599
and get the value out of that as well
 

2723
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,230
and get the value out of that as well
and if both of those come back then we

2724
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:13,240
and if both of those come back then we
 

2725
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,309
and if both of those come back then we
know that that is going to work for us

2726
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:15,319
know that that is going to work for us
 

2727
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:17,030
know that that is going to work for us
then of course we have to come in here

2728
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:17,040
then of course we have to come in here
 

2729
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,190
then of course we have to come in here
and we want to end this guy right here

2730
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,200
and we want to end this guy right here
 

2731
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,510
and we want to end this guy right here
so we go end and a comma another thing

2732
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:21,520
so we go end and a comma another thing
 

2733
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,750
so we go end and a comma another thing
we can do is we can also check if it is

2734
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:24,760
we can do is we can also check if it is
 

2735
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,870
we can do is we can also check if it is
less than and I'm going to let you use

2736
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:26,880
less than and I'm going to let you use
 

2737
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,430
less than and I'm going to let you use
that as your homework assignment to

2738
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:28,440
that as your homework assignment to
 

2739
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,870
that as your homework assignment to
figure out exactly how to make sure that

2740
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:30,880
figure out exactly how to make sure that
 

2741
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,549
figure out exactly how to make sure that
these values work for whether a table is

2742
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:33,559
these values work for whether a table is
 

2743
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:36,309
these values work for whether a table is
less than or also if it's less than or

2744
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319
less than or also if it's less than or
 

2745
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,870
less than or also if it's less than or
equal to another object right there and

2746
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
equal to another object right there and
 

2747
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,670
equal to another object right there and
then also figure out exactly how

2748
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:40,680
then also figure out exactly how
 

2749
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,349
then also figure out exactly how
subtraction and multiplication and

2750
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:42,359
subtraction and multiplication and
 

2751
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,349
subtraction and multiplication and
division works hint hint hint it's going

2752
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:44,359
division works hint hint hint it's going
 

2753
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:45,829
division works hint hint hint it's going
to be something very very similar to

2754
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:45,839
to be something very very similar to
 

2755
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,589
to be something very very similar to
this guy right here okay so now that we

2756
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
this guy right here okay so now that we
 

2757
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,710
this guy right here okay so now that we
have our meta table all set up we need

2758
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:49,720
have our meta table all set up we need
 

2759
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,430
have our meta table all set up we need
to attach The Meta methods to our table

2760
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:53,440
to attach The Meta methods to our table
 

2761
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,750
to attach The Meta methods to our table
how you do that is go set meta table and

2762
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:56,760
how you do that is go set meta table and
 

2763
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,549
how you do that is go set meta table and
and there's the table we're going to

2764
00:49:58,549 --> 00:49:58,559
and there's the table we're going to
 

2765
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,589
and there's the table we're going to
assign it to and there is our meta table

2766
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:01,599
assign it to and there is our meta table
 

2767
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,950
assign it to and there is our meta table
so met set meta table right like that

2768
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:03,960
so met set meta table right like that
 

2769
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,430
so met set meta table right like that
and then we can come in and check if

2770
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:05,440
and then we can come in and check if
 

2771
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,870
and then we can come in and check if
they were equal so a table is equal to a

2772
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
they were equal so a table is equal to a
 

2773
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,470
they were equal so a table is equal to a
table that's going to work of course and

2774
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:11,480
table that's going to work of course and
 

2775
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,990
table that's going to work of course and
had a little bit of a bug up here in the

2776
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:13,000
had a little bit of a bug up here in the
 

2777
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,430
had a little bit of a bug up here in the
a table change that to uppercase right

2778
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:15,440
a table change that to uppercase right
 

2779
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,309
a table change that to uppercase right
like that and then down here inside of

2780
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:17,319
like that and then down here inside of
 

2781
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:19,069
like that and then down here inside of
the equality check make sure that those

2782
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:19,079
the equality check make sure that those
 

2783
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,710
the equality check make sure that those
are equal fix that and if we do that and

2784
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:21,720
are equal fix that and if we do that and
 

2785
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,150
are equal fix that and if we do that and
execute you're going to see that this

2786
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:23,160
execute you're going to see that this
 

2787
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,109
execute you're going to see that this
comes back as true just as you may have

2788
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:25,119
comes back as true just as you may have
 

2789
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,109
comes back as true just as you may have
thought with this right here and now

2790
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:27,119
thought with this right here and now
 

2791
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,549
thought with this right here and now
we're going to test what we did in

2792
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:29,559
we're going to test what we did in
 

2793
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,270
we're going to test what we did in
regards to adding tables so we're going

2794
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
regards to adding tables so we're going
 

2795
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,750
regards to adding tables so we're going
to create a new table called add table

2796
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:33,760
to create a new table called add table
 

2797
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,470
to create a new table called add table
and then we can go add table is equal to

2798
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:36,480
and then we can go add table is equal to
 

2799
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,390
and then we can go add table is equal to
and then we'll just pass in a table we

2800
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:38,400
and then we'll just pass in a table we
 

2801
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,430
and then we'll just pass in a table we
can pass in different ones but it

2802
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:40,440
can pass in different ones but it
 

2803
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,510
can pass in different ones but it
doesn't really matter and a table and

2804
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:42,520
doesn't really matter and a table and
 

2805
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,109
doesn't really matter and a table and
you've seen this before we can just

2806
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:44,119
you've seen this before we can just
 

2807
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:46,190
you've seen this before we can just
create a simple for Loop that's going to

2808
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:46,200
create a simple for Loop that's going to
 

2809
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,270
create a simple for Loop that's going to
allow us to cycle through our new ad

2810
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:48,280
allow us to cycle through our new ad
 

2811
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,109
allow us to cycle through our new ad
table we just created right here and

2812
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:50,119
table we just created right here and
 

2813
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,829
table we just created right here and
whenever we execute it it's going to add

2814
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:51,839
whenever we execute it it's going to add
 

2815
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,670
whenever we execute it it's going to add
all those values together in our brand

2816
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
all those values together in our brand
 

2817
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,270
all those values together in our brand
new table and print them out on the

2818
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:55,280
new table and print them out on the
 

2819
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,870
new table and print them out on the
screen so there's meta table and meta

2820
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:57,880
screen so there's meta table and meta
 

2821
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,109
screen so there's meta table and meta
methods and how we can work with them

2822
00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:00,119
methods and how we can work with them
 

2823
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:02,190
methods and how we can work with them
now let's take a look at objectoriented

2824
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:02,200
now let's take a look at objectoriented
 

2825
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,789
now let's take a look at objectoriented
programming or at least Louis version of

2826
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:04,799
programming or at least Louis version of
 

2827
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:06,870
programming or at least Louis version of
object-oriented programming okay so just

2828
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:06,880
object-oriented programming okay so just
 

2829
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,670
object-oriented programming okay so just
so to make this very clear Lua is not an

2830
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
so to make this very clear Lua is not an
 

2831
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,270
so to make this very clear Lua is not an
oop language and it doesn't allow you to

2832
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:12,280
oop language and it doesn't allow you to
 

2833
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,870
oop language and it doesn't allow you to
Define classes but you can in some ways

2834
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:14,880
Define classes but you can in some ways
 

2835
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,510
Define classes but you can in some ways
fake it using tables and meta tables so

2836
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
fake it using tables and meta tables so
 

2837
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,230
fake it using tables and meta tables so
what we're going to do here is we're

2838
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:19,240
what we're going to do here is we're
 

2839
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,950
what we're going to do here is we're
going to create an animal table right

2840
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:21,960
going to create an animal table right
 

2841
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,510
going to create an animal table right
like this and I'm going to Define all

2842
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:24,520
like this and I'm going to Define all
 

2843
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,030
like this and I'm going to Define all
the default values for everything inside

2844
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
the default values for everything inside
 

2845
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,190
the default values for everything inside
of it so we'll have a height and a

2846
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
of it so we'll have a height and a
 

2847
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,430
of it so we'll have a height and a
weight equal to zero and we'll also have

2848
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:32,440
weight equal to zero and we'll also have
 

2849
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,710
weight equal to zero and we'll also have
a name the default name is going to be

2850
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:34,720
a name the default name is going to be
 

2851
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,270
a name the default name is going to be
no name and then we'll also have our

2852
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:37,280
no name and then we'll also have our
 

2853
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,750
no name and then we'll also have our
animal type of objects also have a sound

2854
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
animal type of objects also have a sound
 

2855
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,990
animal type of objects also have a sound
let's just have no sound okay so there

2856
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:44,000
let's just have no sound okay so there
 

2857
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,069
let's just have no sound okay so there
is the table we have created for animal

2858
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:47,079
is the table we have created for animal
 

2859
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,950
is the table we have created for animal
or the object that we were trying to

2860
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:48,960
or the object that we were trying to
 

2861
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,670
or the object that we were trying to
create inside of here now we have to

2862
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:50,680
create inside of here now we have to
 

2863
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,309
create inside of here now we have to
define a function for our table that's

2864
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:53,319
define a function for our table that's
 

2865
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,750
define a function for our table that's
going to allow us to initialize this guy

2866
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:55,760
going to allow us to initialize this guy
 

2867
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,829
going to allow us to initialize this guy
and how we do that is with function

2868
00:51:57,829 --> 00:51:57,839
and how we do that is with function
 

2869
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,950
and how we do that is with function
animal and I'm going to give it the name

2870
00:51:59,950 --> 00:51:59,960
animal and I'm going to give it the name
 

2871
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,789
animal and I'm going to give it the name
of new and it is going to receive a

2872
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:02,799
of new and it is going to receive a
 

2873
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:06,829
of new and it is going to receive a
height a weight a name and a sound very

2874
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:06,839
height a weight a name and a sound very
 

2875
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,789
height a weight a name and a sound very
similar to an objectoriented programming

2876
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:08,799
similar to an objectoriented programming
 

2877
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:10,230
similar to an objectoriented programming
language what we're going to have to do

2878
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:10,240
language what we're going to have to do
 

2879
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,950
language what we're going to have to do
now is set our meta table and we're just

2880
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
now is set our meta table and we're just
 

2881
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,870
now is set our meta table and we're just
going to throw in a junk table right

2882
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:14,880
going to throw in a junk table right
 

2883
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,190
going to throw in a junk table right
there and then animal right there so

2884
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,200
there and then animal right there so
 

2885
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,789
there and then animal right there so
that's how simple it is to create that

2886
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:18,799
that's how simple it is to create that
 

2887
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:22,030
that's how simple it is to create that
meta table now if we want to refer to

2888
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:22,040
meta table now if we want to refer to
 

2889
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,910
meta table now if we want to refer to
height weight name and sound for our

2890
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920
height weight name and sound for our
 

2891
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,349
height weight name and sound for our
animal objects we use self cuz we don't

2892
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:26,359
animal objects we use self cuz we don't
 

2893
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:28,109
animal objects we use self cuz we don't
know know what the name of it is so

2894
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:28,119
know know what the name of it is so
 

2895
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:30,069
know know what the name of it is so
we're going to say like this and we'll

2896
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
we're going to say like this and we'll
 

2897
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,990
we're going to say like this and we'll
just go and create that then we need to

2898
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
just go and create that then we need to
 

2899
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,150
just go and create that then we need to
do that for all of the other different

2900
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,160
do that for all of the other different
 

2901
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,069
do that for all of the other different
attributes we want for our animal

2902
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:36,079
attributes we want for our animal
 

2903
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,910
attributes we want for our animal
objects so we're also going to have

2904
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:37,920
objects so we're also going to have
 

2905
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,150
objects so we're also going to have
weight and change this to weight and

2906
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,160
weight and change this to weight and
 

2907
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,470
weight and change this to weight and
then we're going to have name and then

2908
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
then we're going to have name and then
 

2909
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,150
then we're going to have name and then
finally sound so we're creating it in

2910
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:45,160
finally sound so we're creating it in
 

2911
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,910
finally sound so we're creating it in
very similar ways to what you have seen

2912
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:46,920
very similar ways to what you have seen
 

2913
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,430
very similar ways to what you have seen
in other programming languages and this

2914
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:48,440
in other programming languages and this
 

2915
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,630
in other programming languages and this
is going to initialize and create a new

2916
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
is going to initialize and create a new
 

2917
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,390
is going to initialize and create a new
animal object and after it initializes

2918
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:53,400
animal object and after it initializes
 

2919
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,670
animal object and after it initializes
everything it's going to return that

2920
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:54,680
everything it's going to return that
 

2921
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,309
everything it's going to return that
animal object of course and the function

2922
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:56,319
animal object of course and the function
 

2923
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,470
animal object of course and the function
with end say we wanted to come in here

2924
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:58,480
with end say we wanted to come in here
 

2925
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,430
with end say we wanted to come in here
and also create a function that is going

2926
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:00,440
and also create a function that is going
 

2927
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,670
and also create a function that is going
to allow us to print out information

2928
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:02,680
to allow us to print out information
 

2929
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,069
to allow us to print out information
about our animal object let's call it

2930
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:05,079
about our animal object let's call it
 

2931
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:07,030
about our animal object let's call it
two string it's not going to receive

2932
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
two string it's not going to receive
 

2933
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,230
two string it's not going to receive
anything and we can then go animal

2934
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:09,240
anything and we can then go animal
 

2935
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,510
anything and we can then go animal
string like this and string this is

2936
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:12,520
string like this and string this is
 

2937
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,710
string like this and string this is
another way of using string format that

2938
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,720
another way of using string format that
 

2939
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,549
another way of using string format that
I haven't showed you and we could just

2940
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:16,559
I haven't showed you and we could just
 

2941
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,470
I haven't showed you and we could just
go sign s ways and then let's get a

2942
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
go sign s ways and then let's get a
 

2943
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,430
go sign s ways and then let's get a
weight for our animal pounds is s on F

2944
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:25,440
weight for our animal pounds is s on F
 

2945
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,030
weight for our animal pounds is s on F
Ines tall and says and let's get the

2946
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:30,040
Ines tall and says and let's get the
 

2947
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,349
Ines tall and says and let's get the
sound that it's going to make then if we

2948
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:32,359
sound that it's going to make then if we
 

2949
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:34,190
sound that it's going to make then if we
want to import all those things for our

2950
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:34,200
want to import all those things for our
 

2951
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,510
want to import all those things for our
specific animal object we're going to go

2952
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:36,520
specific animal object we're going to go
 

2953
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,430
specific animal object we're going to go
and get the self name and self weight

2954
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:40,440
and get the self name and self weight
 

2955
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,870
and get the self name and self weight
and self height and then whoops make

2956
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:43,880
and self height and then whoops make
 

2957
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,589
and self height and then whoops make
sure we do this right self height like

2958
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:46,599
sure we do this right self height like
 

2959
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,030
sure we do this right self height like
that and then finally self sound so that

2960
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:50,040
that and then finally self sound so that
 

2961
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,270
that and then finally self sound so that
is a way for us to import all of those

2962
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:52,280
is a way for us to import all of those
 

2963
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,470
is a way for us to import all of those
specific things for our animal into the

2964
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,480
specific things for our animal into the
 

2965
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,270
specific things for our animal into the
two string function here and then we can

2966
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:56,280
two string function here and then we can
 

2967
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,150
two string function here and then we can
just just go return animal string and

2968
00:53:59,150 --> 00:53:59,160
just just go return animal string and
 

2969
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,870
just just go return animal string and
end that function so this is an object

2970
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:01,880
end that function so this is an object
 

2971
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,150
end that function so this is an object
function inside of here and this is how

2972
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:04,160
function inside of here and this is how
 

2973
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,470
function inside of here and this is how
we initialize it and this is all the

2974
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:06,480
we initialize it and this is all the
 

2975
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,030
we initialize it and this is all the
defaults and The Meta table we Define

2976
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,040
defaults and The Meta table we Define
 

2977
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,190
defaults and The Meta table we Define
for it so it's all very very similar to

2978
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:11,200
for it so it's all very very similar to
 

2979
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,910
for it so it's all very very similar to
things we've seen in the past so let's

2980
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:12,920
things we've seen in the past so let's
 

2981
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,990
things we've seen in the past so let's
go and create an animal object let's

2982
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,000
go and create an animal object let's
 

2983
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,230
go and create an animal object let's
call it spot how we do that is we would

2984
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:17,240
call it spot how we do that is we would
 

2985
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,030
call it spot how we do that is we would
go animal and we call our initialization

2986
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:20,040
go animal and we call our initialization
 

2987
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,950
go animal and we call our initialization
function and let's just pass some junk

2988
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:21,960
function and let's just pass some junk
 

2989
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,670
function and let's just pass some junk
values inside of here there's his name

2990
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:24,680
values inside of here there's his name
 

2991
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,190
values inside of here there's his name
and then his sound let say a sound is

2992
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:27,200
and then his sound let say a sound is
 

2993
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,470
and then his sound let say a sound is
Wolf because that makes sense okay so we

2994
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:29,480
Wolf because that makes sense okay so we
 

2995
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,270
Wolf because that makes sense okay so we
just called for our animal object to be

2996
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,280
just called for our animal object to be
 

2997
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,589
just called for our animal object to be
initialized we could then come in and go

2998
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:33,599
initialized we could then come in and go
 

2999
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,789
initialized we could then come in and go
print spot weight like that and then we

3000
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:36,799
print spot weight like that and then we
 

3001
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,309
print spot weight like that and then we
could also go print spot and then if we

3002
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:39,319
could also go print spot and then if we
 

3003
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:41,990
could also go print spot and then if we
want to call the function we just go to

3004
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,000
want to call the function we just go to
 

3005
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,309
want to call the function we just go to
string like this two string it doesn't

3006
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:44,319
string like this two string it doesn't
 

3007
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,390
string like this two string it doesn't
have to have that name it's just the

3008
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:45,400
have to have that name it's just the
 

3009
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,150
have to have that name it's just the
name I gave it that said it was

3010
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,160
name I gave it that said it was
 

3011
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,190
name I gave it that said it was
unexpected let's put this quote inside

3012
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
unexpected let's put this quote inside
 

3013
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,870
unexpected let's put this quote inside
here that should fix it and there you

3014
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
here that should fix it and there you
 

3015
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,549
here that should fix it and there you
can see it works so 15 comes out that is

3016
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:53,559
can see it works so 15 comes out that is
 

3017
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:55,390
can see it works so 15 comes out that is
how we're accessing the weight with the

3018
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:55,400
how we're accessing the weight with the
 

3019
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,549
how we're accessing the weight with the
dot operator right like this and then we

3020
00:54:57,549 --> 00:54:57,559
dot operator right like this and then we
 

3021
00:54:57,559 --> 00:54:58,870
dot operator right like this and then we
can call that function which is

3022
00:54:58,870 --> 00:54:58,880
can call that function which is
 

3023
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,309
can call that function which is
automatically going to get all that

3024
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:00,319
automatically going to get all that
 

3025
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,470
automatically going to get all that
information about spot and print it

3026
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:02,480
information about spot and print it
 

3027
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,390
information about spot and print it
right there on our screen so you may ask

3028
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:04,400
right there on our screen so you may ask
 

3029
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,230
right there on our screen so you may ask
yourself well does inheritance work

3030
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
yourself well does inheritance work
 

3031
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,309
yourself well does inheritance work
inside of Lua well yes it does and this

3032
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
inside of Lua well yes it does and this
 

3033
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,950
inside of Lua well yes it does and this
is how we're going to use it so let's

3034
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:09,960
is how we're going to use it so let's
 

3035
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,950
is how we're going to use it so let's
say we want to create a brand new object

3036
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:11,960
say we want to create a brand new object
 

3037
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,390
say we want to create a brand new object
called cat we can inherit all of the

3038
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,400
called cat we can inherit all of the
 

3039
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,630
called cat we can inherit all of the
functions defined inside of our animal

3040
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:17,640
functions defined inside of our animal
 

3041
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,990
functions defined inside of our animal
object just by calling new right like

3042
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,000
object just by calling new right like
 

3043
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,789
object just by calling new right like
this there we go now we have all we have

3044
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:22,799
this there we go now we have all we have
 

3045
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,910
this there we go now we have all we have
the two string we have the height weight

3046
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:24,920
the two string we have the height weight
 

3047
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,829
the two string we have the height weight
