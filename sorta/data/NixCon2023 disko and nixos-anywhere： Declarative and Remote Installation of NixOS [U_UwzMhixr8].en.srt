Luz I and we're gonna talk about a joint

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:23,580
Luz I and we're gonna talk about a joint
 

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,429
Luz I and we're gonna talk about a joint
project which is consisting of two

10
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
project which is consisting of two
 

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,870
project which is consisting of two
components that we will present because

12
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
components that we will present because
 

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,330
components that we will present because
we cannot take them in isolation on this

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,340
we cannot take them in isolation on this
 

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,830
we cannot take them in isolation on this
disco and the other one is Nexus

16
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:30,840
disco and the other one is Nexus
 

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,950
disco and the other one is Nexus
anywhere

18
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:33,960

 

19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,510

um so what's the motivation for building

20
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
um so what's the motivation for building
 

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,950
um so what's the motivation for building
these things so we work with num type

22
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:39,960
these things so we work with num type
 

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,350
these things so we work with num type
um and we install Nexus on a lot of

24
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:42,360
um and we install Nexus on a lot of
 

25
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,470
um and we install Nexus on a lot of
machines we have a range of customers

26
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:45,480
machines we have a range of customers
 

27
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,990
machines we have a range of customers
then you get like two at some point you

28
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
then you get like two at some point you
 

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,090
then you get like two at some point you
have like went through all the providers

30
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,100
have like went through all the providers
 

31
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,150
have like went through all the providers
that exist and after some time it

32
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,160
that exist and after some time it
 

33
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,069
that exist and after some time it
becomes like a bit tedious to like adapt

34
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
becomes like a bit tedious to like adapt
 

35
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,990
becomes like a bit tedious to like adapt
to every of these platforms

36
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,000
to every of these platforms
 

37
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,270
to every of these platforms
and also installing Express takes some

38
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
and also installing Express takes some
 

39
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,770
and also installing Express takes some
time

40
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:00,780
time
 

41
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,389
time
um so in the beginning we were uploading

42
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
um so in the beginning we were uploading
 

43
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,310
um so in the beginning we were uploading
install images to the various platforms

44
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
install images to the various platforms
 

45
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,450
install images to the various platforms
and each platform is a little bit

46
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:05,460
and each platform is a little bit
 

47
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,710
and each platform is a little bit
different some of them don't even

48
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
different some of them don't even
 

49
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,230
different some of them don't even
provide you this method so we were

50
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,240
provide you this method so we were
 

51
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,630
provide you this method so we were
looking for something that allows us to

52
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:11,640
looking for something that allows us to
 

53
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,870
looking for something that allows us to
install Nexus anywhere in a more uniform

54
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:13,880
install Nexus anywhere in a more uniform
 

55
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,969
install Nexus anywhere in a more uniform
fashion and this is than what mixes

56
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:16,979
fashion and this is than what mixes
 

57
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,649
fashion and this is than what mixes
anywhere became

58
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:18,659
anywhere became
 

59
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,390
anywhere became
so to give you a little bit of a

60
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
so to give you a little bit of a
 

61
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,609
so to give you a little bit of a
background of what steps you could throw

62
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:22,619
background of what steps you could throw
 

63
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,890
background of what steps you could throw
if you install Nexus

64
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:24,900
if you install Nexus
 

65
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,990
if you install Nexus
first we need to boot into an access

66
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,000
first we need to boot into an access
 

67
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,609
first we need to boot into an access
install ideally

68
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:28,619
install ideally
 

69
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,530
install ideally
and this also depends highly on your

70
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:30,540
and this also depends highly on your
 

71
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,410
and this also depends highly on your
target so over to machine you maybe have

72
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,420
target so over to machine you maybe have
 

73
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,490
target so over to machine you maybe have
like a virtual machine image or

74
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
like a virtual machine image or
 

75
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,370
like a virtual machine image or
something like that or bare metal

76
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:36,380
something like that or bare metal
 

77
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,870
something like that or bare metal
servers you have something like PC board

78
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
servers you have something like PC board
 

79
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,609
servers you have something like PC board
on a laptop you put in a USB stick

80
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:42,619
on a laptop you put in a USB stick
 

81
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,850
on a laptop you put in a USB stick
then you need to partition the fast

82
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:46,860
then you need to partition the fast
 

83
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,429
then you need to partition the fast
disks that you have add some file

84
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
disks that you have add some file
 

85
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,490
disks that you have add some file
systems and then Mount these to location

86
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:52,500
systems and then Mount these to location
 

87
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,710
systems and then Mount these to location
and then you have to write some next

88
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
and then you have to write some next
 

89
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,690
and then you have to write some next
question configuration or you copied

90
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:56,700
question configuration or you copied
 

91
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,210
question configuration or you copied
over from a previous system and then you

92
00:01:59,210 --> 00:01:59,220
over from a previous system and then you
 

93
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,910
over from a previous system and then you
run Nexus install and then you reboot so

94
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
run Nexus install and then you reboot so
 

95
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,310
run Nexus install and then you reboot so
stack five steps takes a lot of time if

96
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
stack five steps takes a lot of time if
 

97
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,889
stack five steps takes a lot of time if
you have to do it at scale

98
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:06,899
you have to do it at scale
 

99
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,990
you have to do it at scale
um and also something that this may be

100
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,000
um and also something that this may be
 

101
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,630
um and also something that this may be
error genius if you like do something

102
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,640
error genius if you like do something
 

103
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,250
error genius if you like do something
slightly different than you didn't

104
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,260
slightly different than you didn't
 

105
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,130
slightly different than you didn't
document it how you did

106
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,140
document it how you did
 

107
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,530
document it how you did
so let's take this and

108
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:18,540
so let's take this and
 

109
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,110
so let's take this and
simplify this and this is what we did

110
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
simplify this and this is what we did
 

111
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,550
simplify this and this is what we did
with two projects

112
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
with two projects
 

113
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,910
with two projects
how one is called disco and disco you

114
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
how one is called disco and disco you
 

115
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,550
how one is called disco and disco you
specify your this configuration in a

116
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
specify your this configuration in a
 

117
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,490
specify your this configuration in a
declarative way like we love to do so

118
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:31,500
declarative way like we love to do so
 

119
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,270
declarative way like we love to do so
this layout becomes uh next next code

120
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,280
this layout becomes uh next next code
 

121
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,890
this layout becomes uh next next code
and then Nexus anywhere is the second

122
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:36,900
and then Nexus anywhere is the second
 

123
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,470
and then Nexus anywhere is the second
tool it takes this Nexus configuration

124
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,480
tool it takes this Nexus configuration
 

125
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,050
tool it takes this Nexus configuration
attaches your Discord layout configured

126
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,060
attaches your Discord layout configured
 

127
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,170
attaches your Discord layout configured
and then it has a single command that

128
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,180
and then it has a single command that
 

129
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,309
and then it has a single command that
uses SSH to install excess

130
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319

 

131
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,410

okay so I'm going to talk about disco

132
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:51,420
okay so I'm going to talk about disco
 

133
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,110
okay so I'm going to talk about disco
briefly so what is disco basically it's

134
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120
briefly so what is disco basically it's
 

135
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,630
briefly so what is disco basically it's
like a Nexus module which takes like a

136
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
like a Nexus module which takes like a
 

137
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,850
like a Nexus module which takes like a
configuration with some strings and it

138
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:58,860
configuration with some strings and it
 

139
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,710
configuration with some strings and it
outputs two scripts one is to format

140
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
outputs two scripts one is to format
 

141
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,990
outputs two scripts one is to format
your disks one is to mount them and also

142
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,000
your disks one is to mount them and also
 

143
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,369
your disks one is to mount them and also
some Nexus configuration to actually

144
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:04,379
some Nexus configuration to actually
 

145
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,350
some Nexus configuration to actually
like configure the file systems and

146
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,360
like configure the file systems and
 

147
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,390
like configure the file systems and
stuff so your system actually boots and

148
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
stuff so your system actually boots and
 

149
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,650
stuff so your system actually boots and
also the rates

150
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:09,660
also the rates
 

151
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,949
also the rates
yeah it uses like some module magic like

152
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
yeah it uses like some module magic like
 

153
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,410
yeah it uses like some module magic like
evil modules like everybody knows best

154
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:15,420
evil modules like everybody knows best
 

155
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,449
evil modules like everybody knows best
feature of nexos

156
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:17,459
feature of nexos
 

157
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,149
feature of nexos
and so yeah one very I often asked

158
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
and so yeah one very I often asked
 

159
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,949
and so yeah one very I often asked
question is why don't we use systemd

160
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:21,959
question is why don't we use systemd
 

161
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,869
question is why don't we use systemd
report because it has basically no

162
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
report because it has basically no
 

163
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,449
report because it has basically no
features you can just specify a single

164
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:26,459
features you can just specify a single
 

165
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,850
features you can just specify a single
disk you can or you cannot use ZFS you

166
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:28,860
disk you can or you cannot use ZFS you
 

167
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,490
disk you can or you cannot use ZFS you
cannot do any lvm stuff with multi-discs

168
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,500
cannot do any lvm stuff with multi-discs
 

169
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,830
cannot do any lvm stuff with multi-discs
so yeah that's basically it's like very

170
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
so yeah that's basically it's like very
 

171
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,229
so yeah that's basically it's like very
limited to appliances and we love our

172
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
limited to appliances and we love our
 

173
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,330
limited to appliances and we love our
setup first we have it everywhere so I

174
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,340
setup first we have it everywhere so I
 

175
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,949
setup first we have it everywhere so I
don't really have said I said the first

176
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:39,959
don't really have said I said the first
 

177
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,110
don't really have said I said the first
time we get set yeah exactly if you

178
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,120
time we get set yeah exactly if you
 

179
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,030
time we get set yeah exactly if you
don't have CFS yeah nothing works but a

180
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,040
don't have CFS yeah nothing works but a
 

181
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,890
don't have CFS yeah nothing works but a
repart has some cool features which

182
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:45,900
repart has some cool features which
 

183
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,869
repart has some cool features which
disco doesn't have yet so there's like

184
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:47,879
disco doesn't have yet so there's like
 

185
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,089
disco doesn't have yet so there's like
disk image creation without a VM so they

186
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:50,099
disk image creation without a VM so they
 

187
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,309
disk image creation without a VM so they
do like cool stuff with this Auto resize

188
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
do like cool stuff with this Auto resize
 

189
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,190
do like cool stuff with this Auto resize
I still haven't implemented in Disco and

190
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
I still haven't implemented in Disco and
 

191
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,410
I still haven't implemented in Disco and
like also populate files like this goes

192
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:57,420
like also populate files like this goes
 

193
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,390
like also populate files like this goes
only for partitioning and mounting stuff

194
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,400
only for partitioning and mounting stuff
 

195
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,369
only for partitioning and mounting stuff
not population

196
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:01,379
not population
 

197
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,770
not population
so this is an example how disco looks

198
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:03,780
so this is an example how disco looks
 

199
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,970
so this is an example how disco looks
basically this is like just the

200
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:04,980
basically this is like just the
 

201
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,990
basically this is like just the
partition table slow oops

202
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
partition table slow oops
 

203
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,270
partition table slow oops
I can try to speak slower already so

204
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
I can try to speak slower already so
 

205
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,369
I can try to speak slower already so
there's like uh this is like the disc

206
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:13,379
there's like uh this is like the disc
 

207
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,990
there's like uh this is like the disc
here there's like canis my mouth

208
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,000
here there's like canis my mouth
 

209
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,469
here there's like canis my mouth
actually yeah cool okay so here's like

210
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
actually yeah cool okay so here's like
 

211
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,409
actually yeah cool okay so here's like
the main disk you can point it at some

212
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:21,419
the main disk you can point it at some
 

213
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,450
the main disk you can point it at some
random device like it should exist of

214
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:23,460
random device like it should exist of
 

215
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,310
random device like it should exist of
course if you want to format it

216
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,320
course if you want to format it
 

217
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,469
course if you want to format it
and then you say it's like a GPT

218
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:27,479
and then you say it's like a GPT
 

219
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,810
and then you say it's like a GPT
partition table in here so the device is

220
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:29,820
partition table in here so the device is
 

221
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,090
partition table in here so the device is
only used during the initial creation of

222
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,100
only used during the initial creation of
 

223
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,610
only used during the initial creation of
the partition table uh later it's not

224
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:34,620
the partition table uh later it's not
 

225
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,530
the partition table uh later it's not
going to be used anymore if you use the

226
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:36,540
going to be used anymore if you use the
 

227
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,629
going to be used anymore if you use the
new GPT type if you use the Legacy table

228
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
new GPT type if you use the Legacy table
 

229
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,610
new GPT type if you use the Legacy table
type stuff will break don't use that

230
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:40,620
type stuff will break don't use that
 

231
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,990
type stuff will break don't use that
anymore

232
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
anymore
 

233
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,210
anymore
so so the background here is that you

234
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:44,220
so so the background here is that you
 

235
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,090
so so the background here is that you
provide your device and then it will put

236
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,100
provide your device and then it will put
 

237
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,210
provide your device and then it will put
when it creates a GPT table it will make

238
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,220
when it creates a GPT table it will make
 

239
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,550
when it creates a GPT table it will make
a label so then when you have example we

240
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
a label so then when you have example we
 

241
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,830
a label so then when you have example we
have two nvmes and they get swapped

242
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
have two nvmes and they get swapped
 

243
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,230
have two nvmes and they get swapped
around for random reason and you might

244
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,240
around for random reason and you might
 

245
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,390
around for random reason and you might
have trying to mount the wrong one so

246
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,400
have trying to mount the wrong one so
 

247
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,830
have trying to mount the wrong one so
you want to have labels and this is what

248
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:00,840
you want to have labels and this is what
 

249
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,170
you want to have labels and this is what
this GPT TF is doing

250
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,180
this GPT TF is doing
 

251
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,409
this GPT TF is doing
basically yeah so yeah uh this is

252
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:06,419
basically yeah so yeah uh this is
 

253
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,969
basically yeah so yeah uh this is
basically the advanced feature of that

254
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:07,979
basically the advanced feature of that
 

255
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,830
basically the advanced feature of that
so because it's like Nexus config you

256
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
so because it's like Nexus config you
 

257
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,870
so because it's like Nexus config you
can split it over multiple files and

258
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:11,880
can split it over multiple files and
 

259
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,969
can split it over multiple files and
this is basically what the partition

260
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:13,979
this is basically what the partition
 

261
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,830
this is basically what the partition
table would look like so we have like a

262
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
table would look like so we have like a
 

263
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,409
table would look like so we have like a
AV partition there for 500 megabytes

264
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:18,419
AV partition there for 500 megabytes
 

265
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,350
AV partition there for 500 megabytes
with a

266
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,360
with a
 

267
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,969
with a
boot file system on there where you can

268
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:22,979
boot file system on there where you can
 

269
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,310
boot file system on there where you can
also specify the mount Point here then

270
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,320
also specify the mount Point here then
 

271
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,170
also specify the mount Point here then
you have the root

272
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,180
you have the root
 

273
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,170
you have the root
partition which is 100 and the content

274
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,180
partition which is 100 and the content
 

275
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,870
partition which is 100 and the content
is like an extended for file system

276
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
is like an extended for file system
 

277
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,870
is like an extended for file system
so yeah that's very basic I guess I

278
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:35,880
so yeah that's very basic I guess I
 

279
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,850
so yeah that's very basic I guess I
guess this everybody expected so it

280
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:37,860
guess this everybody expected so it
 

281
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,230
guess this everybody expected so it
should work in excess

282
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,240
should work in excess
 

283
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,249
should work in excess
yeah

284
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,259
yeah
 

285
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,110
yeah
the tricky part becomes then when you

286
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,120
the tricky part becomes then when you
 

287
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,090
the tricky part becomes then when you
then have a set of us for example with

288
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,100
then have a set of us for example with
 

289
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,730
then have a set of us for example with
multiple devices yeah yeah you built

290
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:46,740
multiple devices yeah yeah you built
 

291
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,490
multiple devices yeah yeah you built
your new shiny nixos.org binary cache

292
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:49,500
your new shiny nixos.org binary cache
 

293
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,029
your new shiny nixos.org binary cache
was like 25 hard drives and then fix

294
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
was like 25 hard drives and then fix
 

295
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,610
was like 25 hard drives and then fix
become a bit more a bit more longer

296
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:55,620
become a bit more a bit more longer
 

297
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,370
become a bit more a bit more longer
basically yeah other cool features that

298
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:58,380
basically yeah other cool features that
 

299
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,830
basically yeah other cool features that
have multiple devices the examples are a

300
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:00,840
have multiple devices the examples are a
 

301
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,050
have multiple devices the examples are a
bit too long to put them here rates with

302
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,060
bit too long to put them here rates with
 

303
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,770
bit too long to put them here rates with
mdadm lvm Lux encryption B cash FS you

304
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:06,780
mdadm lvm Lux encryption B cash FS you
 

305
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,510
mdadm lvm Lux encryption B cash FS you
can also create disk images with disco

306
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,520
can also create disk images with disco
 

307
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,129
can also create disk images with disco
which is quite nice so if you have like

308
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:10,139
which is quite nice so if you have like
 

309
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,350
which is quite nice so if you have like
a this configuration with multiple disks

310
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,360
a this configuration with multiple disks
 

311
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,050
a this configuration with multiple disks
you actually get multiple image files

312
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,060
you actually get multiple image files
 

313
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,510
you actually get multiple image files
out of it so you could maybe create a

314
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
out of it so you could maybe create a
 

315
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,950
out of it so you could maybe create a
ZFS rate from USB sticks and put this

316
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:21,960
ZFS rate from USB sticks and put this
 

317
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,409
ZFS rate from USB sticks and put this
yeah everything is possible like check

318
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:24,419
yeah everything is possible like check
 

319
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,909
yeah everything is possible like check
out the examples folder in the Disco

320
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
out the examples folder in the Disco
 

321
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,950
out the examples folder in the Disco
thing this is actually a link if you

322
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:27,960
thing this is actually a link if you
 

323
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,629
thing this is actually a link if you
would have the slide then they are my

324
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:29,639
would have the slide then they are my
 

325
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,129
would have the slide then they are my
pet to slide so you can click on them

326
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:31,139
pet to slide so you can click on them
 

327
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,029
pet to slide so you can click on them
later

328
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:32,039
later
 

329
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,490
later
uh yeah basically you sell all the cool

330
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:34,500
uh yeah basically you sell all the cool
 

331
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,230
uh yeah basically you sell all the cool
features

332
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
features
 

333
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,450
features
yeah but what what are the problems with

334
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:38,460
yeah but what what are the problems with
 

335
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,850
yeah but what what are the problems with
disco so basically because the options

336
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:40,860
disco so basically because the options
 

337
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,290
disco so basically because the options
are like recursive you can have like a

338
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,300
are like recursive you can have like a
 

339
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,210
are like recursive you can have like a
GPT partition table a lux partition in

340
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,220
GPT partition table a lux partition in
 

341
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,370
GPT partition table a lux partition in
there then like in a GPT partition table

342
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,380
there then like in a GPT partition table
 

343
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,230
there then like in a GPT partition table
again it's like hard to generate the

344
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
again it's like hard to generate the
 

345
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,090
again it's like hard to generate the
documentation for this in like the way

346
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,100
documentation for this in like the way
 

347
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,950
documentation for this in like the way
we do this now for modules because it's

348
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:51,960
we do this now for modules because it's
 

349
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,110
we do this now for modules because it's
like all over the place

350
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,120
like all over the place
 

351
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,390
like all over the place
also we use this weird type syntax so

352
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
also we use this weird type syntax so
 

353
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,129
also we use this weird type syntax so
everything is like polymorphic and

354
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:58,139
everything is like polymorphic and
 

355
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,430
everything is like polymorphic and
everything can be like different types

356
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,440
everything can be like different types
 

357
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,570
everything can be like different types
everywhere yesterday we tried to ask

358
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:02,580
everywhere yesterday we tried to ask
 

359
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,490
everywhere yesterday we tried to ask
Robert tensing because he's like a

360
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,500
Robert tensing because he's like a
 

361
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,809
Robert tensing because he's like a
magician when it comes to the next

362
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:05,819
magician when it comes to the next
 

363
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,450
magician when it comes to the next
module system and first of all first of

364
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:08,460
module system and first of all first of
 

365
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,249
module system and first of all first of
it you didn't believe that we built this

366
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:10,259
it you didn't believe that we built this
 

367
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,490
it you didn't believe that we built this
type so then this got me back here we're

368
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:13,500
type so then this got me back here we're
 

369
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,170
type so then this got me back here we're
still wondering how we can then generate

370
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,180
still wondering how we can then generate
 

371
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,730
still wondering how we can then generate
documentation for this because just now

372
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:16,740
documentation for this because just now
 

373
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,650
documentation for this because just now
you have to look at the examples uh but

374
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:18,660
you have to look at the examples uh but
 

375
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,550
you have to look at the examples uh but
it would be nice to have something

376
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:19,560
it would be nice to have something
 

377
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,189
it would be nice to have something
equivalent to the Nexus manual to the

378
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199
equivalent to the Nexus manual to the
 

379
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,689
equivalent to the Nexus manual to the
reference menu after all the options to

380
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:23,699
reference menu after all the options to
 

381
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:24,469
reference menu after all the options to
find

382
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
find
 

383
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,330
find
and another problem is currently disco

384
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,340
and another problem is currently disco
 

385
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,490
and another problem is currently disco
only works by completely destroying your

386
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:28,500
only works by completely destroying your
 

387
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,490
only works by completely destroying your
partition table first and then

388
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:30,500
partition table first and then
 

389
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,469
partition table first and then
reinstalling it so something is like

390
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:33,479
reinstalling it so something is like
 

391
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,390
reinstalling it so something is like
State transition I want to add to it so

392
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,400
State transition I want to add to it so
 

393
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,010
State transition I want to add to it so
basically it would check what your

394
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,020
basically it would check what your
 

395
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,570
basically it would check what your
current setup would look like and only

396
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:38,580
current setup would look like and only
 

397
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,330
current setup would look like and only
do the non-destructive stuff or like do

398
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:41,340
do the non-destructive stuff or like do
 

399
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,390
do the non-destructive stuff or like do
it in a way that you keep your files

400
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
it in a way that you keep your files
 

401
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,850
it in a way that you keep your files
yeah we really don't try to like have a

402
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:46,860
yeah we really don't try to like have a
 

403
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,350
yeah we really don't try to like have a
Windows installation already there and

404
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,360
Windows installation already there and
 

405
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,089
Windows installation already there and
you need to run disco because it might

406
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:50,099
you need to run disco because it might
 

407
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,749
you need to run disco because it might
be a no longer present so it takes tries

408
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
be a no longer present so it takes tries
 

409
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,330
be a no longer present so it takes tries
to take control over the disk

410
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:56,340
to take control over the disk
 

411
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,850
to take control over the disk
um

412
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:58,860

 

413
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,350

it could be a feature for some people

414
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:00,360
it could be a feature for some people
 

415
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,010
it could be a feature for some people
before there's not okay okay so now we

416
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,020
before there's not okay okay so now we
 

417
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,070
before there's not okay okay so now we
have had have our politicians formatted

418
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,080
have had have our politicians formatted
 

419
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,870
have had have our politicians formatted
um but this is still something very

420
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:08,880
um but this is still something very
 

421
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,909
um but this is still something very
would you need to like um go in manually

422
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
would you need to like um go in manually
 

423
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,469
would you need to like um go in manually
for example this is a disco Library

424
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
for example this is a disco Library
 

425
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,330
for example this is a disco Library
called have the configuration on the

426
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,340
called have the configuration on the
 

427
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,370
called have the configuration on the
system and then run the format in the

428
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:16,380
system and then run the format in the
 

429
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,650
system and then run the format in the
politician formatting and mounting

430
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:18,660
politician formatting and mounting
 

431
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,969
politician formatting and mounting
um it's much nicer if you don't have to

432
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:19,979
um it's much nicer if you don't have to
 

433
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,589
um it's much nicer if you don't have to
do that and you can just form your

434
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
do that and you can just form your
 

435
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,230
do that and you can just form your
laptop or set up your new laptop for

436
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
laptop or set up your new laptop for
 

437
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,050
laptop or set up your new laptop for
example or some server

438
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,060
example or some server
 

439
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,850
example or some server
um so this is where Nexus anywhere came

440
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:28,860
um so this is where Nexus anywhere came
 

441
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,409
um so this is where Nexus anywhere came
in into play

442
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:30,419
in into play
 

443
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,930
in into play
it's a bit like um just imagine like

444
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:32,940
it's a bit like um just imagine like
 

445
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,790
it's a bit like um just imagine like
Nexus install has like a remote flag

446
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
Nexus install has like a remote flag
 

447
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,469
Nexus install has like a remote flag
where you can specify a remote server so

448
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
where you can specify a remote server so
 

449
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,610
where you can specify a remote server so
this is what makes us anywhere else

450
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:37,620
this is what makes us anywhere else
 

451
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,870
this is what makes us anywhere else
doing

452
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
doing
 

453
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,490
doing
um so you have your Nexus configuration

454
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:40,500
um so you have your Nexus configuration
 

455
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,130
um so you have your Nexus configuration
with the Disco configure configuration

456
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:43,140
with the Disco configure configuration
 

457
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,710
with the Disco configure configuration
in there that we just saw then you need

458
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
in there that we just saw then you need
 

459
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,769
in there that we just saw then you need
some SSH decimation and then yeah if you

460
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:48,779
some SSH decimation and then yeah if you
 

461
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,530
some SSH decimation and then yeah if you
run this command it will start doing the

462
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:51,540
run this command it will start doing the
 

463
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,750
run this command it will start doing the
excess installation

464
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
excess installation
 

465
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,690
excess installation
uh so how does this work internally

466
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:56,700
uh so how does this work internally
 

467
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,430
uh so how does this work internally
um so first we log on to the machine

468
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440
um so first we log on to the machine
 

469
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,410
um so first we log on to the machine
then we do some checks we for example

470
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,420
then we do some checks we for example
 

471
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,090
then we do some checks we for example
check like what's are the architecture

472
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,100
check like what's are the architecture
 

473
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,730
check like what's are the architecture
there are we in the next installer SS

474
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:04,740
there are we in the next installer SS
 

475
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,970
there are we in the next installer SS
installer maybe already or not

476
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:07,980
installer maybe already or not
 

477
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,350
installer maybe already or not
um because if you're not in the Nexus

478
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
um because if you're not in the Nexus
 

479
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,170
um because if you're not in the Nexus
installer then we do a trick called cake

480
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,180
installer then we do a trick called cake
 

481
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,570
installer then we do a trick called cake
SEC which I will explain in a little bit

482
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:14,580
SEC which I will explain in a little bit
 

483
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,670
SEC which I will explain in a little bit
um but it allows us to load the Nexus

484
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:16,680
um but it allows us to load the Nexus
 

485
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,670
um but it allows us to load the Nexus
installer into uh the memory

486
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
installer into uh the memory
 

487
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,949
installer into uh the memory
then we run Disco

488
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:21,959
then we run Disco
 

489
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,170
then we run Disco
to do all the partitioning things that

490
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,180
to do all the partitioning things that
 

491
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,170
to do all the partitioning things that
you just saw run Nexus install and then

492
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,180
you just saw run Nexus install and then
 

493
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,050
you just saw run Nexus install and then
reboot and then it's done

494
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,060
reboot and then it's done
 

495
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,949
reboot and then it's done
so back to cake exec

496
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:33,959
so back to cake exec
 

497
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,410
so back to cake exec
um it's a feature that's already for

498
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:36,420
um it's a feature that's already for
 

499
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,630
um it's a feature that's already for
quite a while in in Linux but maybe not

500
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
quite a while in in Linux but maybe not
 

501
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,269
quite a while in in Linux but maybe not
everyone has used it so far but this

502
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
everyone has used it so far but this
 

503
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,009
everyone has used it so far but this
basically allows you if you have a Linux

504
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:43,019
basically allows you if you have a Linux
 

505
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,870
basically allows you if you have a Linux
kernel running you can instruct this

506
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
kernel running you can instruct this
 

507
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,769
kernel running you can instruct this
Linux kernel to take a new kernel and an

508
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:48,779
Linux kernel to take a new kernel and an
 

509
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,710
Linux kernel to take a new kernel and an
internet ID and then just boot that so

510
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:51,720
internet ID and then just boot that so
 

511
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,570
internet ID and then just boot that so
it's used for for example for kernel

512
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:53,580
it's used for for example for kernel
 

513
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,710
it's used for for example for kernel
development because you can quickly

514
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
development because you can quickly
 

515
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,009
development because you can quickly
without going through your

516
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:57,019
without going through your
 

517
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,389
without going through your
firmware you can just boot into a new

518
00:09:59,389 --> 00:09:59,399
firmware you can just boot into a new
 

519
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,190
firmware you can just boot into a new
operating system because sometimes like

520
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
operating system because sometimes like
 

521
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,690
operating system because sometimes like
firmware they take like 10 minutes to

522
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:02,700
firmware they take like 10 minutes to
 

523
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,110
firmware they take like 10 minutes to
boot no kidding

524
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
boot no kidding
 

525
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,650
boot no kidding
and we use this to just load our next OS

526
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:09,660
and we use this to just load our next OS
 

527
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,970
and we use this to just load our next OS
installer into any Linux this has proven

528
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:13,980
installer into any Linux this has proven
 

529
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,370
installer into any Linux this has proven
to be like really generic and nice

530
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,380
to be like really generic and nice
 

531
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,889
to be like really generic and nice
because on every provider you get some

532
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:18,899
because on every provider you get some
 

533
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,470
because on every provider you get some
sort of Ubuntu and they already put your

534
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:21,480
sort of Ubuntu and they already put your
 

535
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,290
sort of Ubuntu and they already put your
SSH key in there so you can just use

536
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,300
SSH key in there so you can just use
 

537
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,030
SSH key in there so you can just use
this and as a starting base for an

538
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,040
this and as a starting base for an
 

539
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,990
this and as a starting base for an
excess configuration

540
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000

 

541
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,389

um so what this is what the usage looks

542
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
um so what this is what the usage looks
 

543
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,430
um so what this is what the usage looks
like we can use next run if you don't

544
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:34,440
like we can use next run if you don't
 

545
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,949
like we can use next run if you don't
want to install it yourself on your

546
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
want to install it yourself on your
 

547
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,590
want to install it yourself on your
systems which if you just want to run as

548
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
systems which if you just want to run as
 

549
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,730
systems which if you just want to run as
a command

550
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:40,740
a command
 

551
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,889
a command
um then you provide with the flag

552
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:42,899
um then you provide with the flag
 

553
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,990
um then you provide with the flag
argument you provide what Nexus system

554
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,000
argument you provide what Nexus system
 

555
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,290
argument you provide what Nexus system
to install and then you specify the

556
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,300
to install and then you specify the
 

557
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,470
to install and then you specify the
hostname so simple as that

558
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:53,480

 

559
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,569

what we found like when you create a new

560
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:56,579
what we found like when you create a new
 

561
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,430
what we found like when you create a new
disk configuration sometimes you don't

562
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:58,440
disk configuration sometimes you don't
 

563
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,750
disk configuration sometimes you don't
get it right the first time and then if

564
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
get it right the first time and then if
 

565
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,130
get it right the first time and then if
you have to reboot the machine it takes

566
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,140
you have to reboot the machine it takes
 

567
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,350
you have to reboot the machine it takes
a while especially if you have not a

568
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
a while especially if you have not a
 

569
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,269
a while especially if you have not a
great cloud provider doesn't have like a

570
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
great cloud provider doesn't have like a
 

571
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,470
great cloud provider doesn't have like a
really slow web interface or something

572
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
really slow web interface or something
 

573
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,630
really slow web interface or something
like that so it's much easier and nicer

574
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
like that so it's much easier and nicer
 

575
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,610
like that so it's much easier and nicer
if you can just test locally that's

576
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:10,620
if you can just test locally that's
 

577
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,889
if you can just test locally that's
that's why there's a VM test option so

578
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:12,899
that's why there's a VM test option so
 

579
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,710
that's why there's a VM test option so
what this does is um it simulates the

580
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:15,720
what this does is um it simulates the
 

581
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,990
what this does is um it simulates the
whole installation in a nexo svm test

582
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
whole installation in a nexo svm test
 

583
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,930
whole installation in a nexo svm test
and then you can see if it already works

584
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:20,940
and then you can see if it already works
 

585
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,150
and then you can see if it already works
and it boots it's maybe not a perfect

586
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,160
and it boots it's maybe not a perfect
 

587
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,030
and it boots it's maybe not a perfect
for everything just now but um yeah it

588
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,040
for everything just now but um yeah it
 

589
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,150
for everything just now but um yeah it
often gives you like make sure that most

590
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,160
often gives you like make sure that most
 

591
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,350
often gives you like make sure that most
of the stuff work

592
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:30,360
of the stuff work
 

593
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,650
of the stuff work
enough of nice features secret support

594
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,660
enough of nice features secret support
 

595
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,170
enough of nice features secret support
so often when you install when you use

596
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,180
so often when you install when you use
 

597
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,949
so often when you install when you use
some of these tools like argonix or sub

598
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:39,959
some of these tools like argonix or sub
 

599
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,810
some of these tools like argonix or sub
snakes then you have this bootstrapping

600
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:41,820
snakes then you have this bootstrapping
 

601
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,490
snakes then you have this bootstrapping
problem that you need first the key to

602
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,500
problem that you need first the key to
 

603
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,410
problem that you need first the key to
decrypt all the other Secrets onto the

604
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:45,420
decrypt all the other Secrets onto the
 

605
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,930
decrypt all the other Secrets onto the
machine

606
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:46,940
machine
 

607
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,210
machine
and um with Nexus anywhere you can also

608
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,220
and um with Nexus anywhere you can also
 

609
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,110
and um with Nexus anywhere you can also
specify flag face just upload other keys

610
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
specify flag face just upload other keys
 

611
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,150
specify flag face just upload other keys
and then you can get all your other

612
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
and then you can get all your other
 

613
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,329
and then you can get all your other
secret tool management working

614
00:11:59,329 --> 00:11:59,339
secret tool management working
 

615
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,650
secret tool management working
so next up

616
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:00,660
so next up
 

617
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,389
so next up
um let's just have a demo I think it's

618
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
um let's just have a demo I think it's
 

619
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,910
um let's just have a demo I think it's
way too small for the people here in the

620
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:04,920
way too small for the people here in the
 

621
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,970
way too small for the people here in the
room oh yeah but what you see is that it

622
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:07,980
room oh yeah but what you see is that it
 

623
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,730
room oh yeah but what you see is that it
runs the VM test so if you're already

624
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:10,740
runs the VM test so if you're already
 

625
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,590
runs the VM test so if you're already
familiar with yeah you know I see like a

626
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:12,600
familiar with yeah you know I see like a
 

627
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,829
familiar with yeah you know I see like a
mix first VM testing this locally but it

628
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
mix first VM testing this locally but it
 

629
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,930
mix first VM testing this locally but it
could be also a server as well

630
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:17,940
could be also a server as well
 

631
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,030
could be also a server as well
but you can see

632
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,040
but you can see
 

633
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,190
but you can see
um it won't take that much time after

634
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,200
um it won't take that much time after
 

635
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,090
um it won't take that much time after
all

636
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,100
all
 

637
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,550
all
so it's already done formatting

638
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:25,560
so it's already done formatting
 

639
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,750
so it's already done formatting
um

640
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,760
um
 

641
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,850
um
uh yeah not already booting so yeah yeah

642
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:30,860
uh yeah not already booting so yeah yeah
 

643
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,410
uh yeah not already booting so yeah yeah
if you get the slice later you can run

644
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:33,420
if you get the slice later you can run
 

645
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,269
if you get the slice later you can run
this on your computer and see how it

646
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
this on your computer and see how it
 

647
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,610
this on your computer and see how it
works or just try it right

648
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:37,620
works or just try it right
 

649
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,470
works or just try it right
um yourself

650
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:39,480
um yourself
 

651
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,769
um yourself
yeah so that's done pretty boring which

652
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:42,779
yeah so that's done pretty boring which
 

653
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:43,850
yeah so that's done pretty boring which
is good

654
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:43,860
is good
 

655
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,069
is good
um

656
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079

 

657
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,509

so yeah like I said just now we use SSH

658
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
so yeah like I said just now we use SSH
 

659
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,250
so yeah like I said just now we use SSH
so we need some machine and some other

660
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:52,260
so we need some machine and some other
 

661
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,350
so we need some machine and some other
Linux that's already exist sometimes

662
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,360
Linux that's already exist sometimes
 

663
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,790
Linux that's already exist sometimes
it's not always true like if you have

664
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:55,800
it's not always true like if you have
 

665
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,350
it's not always true like if you have
like a bare middle server like we have

666
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
like a bare middle server like we have
 

667
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,870
like a bare middle server like we have
in uh the university

668
00:12:59,870 --> 00:12:59,880
in uh the university
 

669
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,449
in uh the university
um then it's also nice if you can just

670
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:02,459
um then it's also nice if you can just
 

671
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,490
um then it's also nice if you can just
use something like a pxe boot which is

672
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:04,500
use something like a pxe boot which is
 

673
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,490
use something like a pxe boot which is
like a feature on your firmware that

674
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:07,500
like a feature on your firmware that
 

675
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,850
like a feature on your firmware that
where the computer is asking for uh

676
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:10,860
where the computer is asking for uh
 

677
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,790
where the computer is asking for uh
operating systems to boot so I have for

678
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:13,800
operating systems to boot so I have for
 

679
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,769
operating systems to boot so I have for
quite a while I have like a branch where

680
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:15,779
quite a while I have like a branch where
 

681
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,730
quite a while I have like a branch where
I implemented that but I never merged it

682
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:19,740
I implemented that but I never merged it
 

683
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,250
I implemented that but I never merged it
because I was still wanting to have some

684
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:22,260
because I was still wanting to have some
 

685
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,490
because I was still wanting to have some
Nexus test working as well so

686
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:25,500
Nexus test working as well so
 

687
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,829
Nexus test working as well so
yeah and this seems to be just now not a

688
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
yeah and this seems to be just now not a
 

689
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,269
yeah and this seems to be just now not a
not a working implementation of that

690
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
not a working implementation of that
 

691
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,190
not a working implementation of that
because you can also ask when you have

692
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
because you can also ask when you have
 

693
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,410
because you can also ask when you have
chemo you can also there's also a Peaks

694
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:33,420
chemo you can also there's also a Peaks
 

695
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,910
chemo you can also there's also a Peaks
e boot feature in there and this is what

696
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:34,920
e boot feature in there and this is what
 

697
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,430
e boot feature in there and this is what
I could use for testing

698
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
I could use for testing
 

699
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,230
I could use for testing
um and what would be also nice is um

700
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:39,240
um and what would be also nice is um
 

701
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,670
um and what would be also nice is um
just now you need

702
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:40,680
just now you need
 

703
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,350
just now you need
um to generate at some point the

704
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:42,360
um to generate at some point the
 

705
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,670
um to generate at some point the
hardware configuration of your target

706
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
hardware configuration of your target
 

707
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,530
hardware configuration of your target
system for example you need Sometimes

708
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:45,540
system for example you need Sometimes
 

709
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,810
system for example you need Sometimes
some special modules so it drives get

710
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:47,820
some special modules so it drives get
 

711
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,090
some special modules so it drives get
recognized and just know this is also

712
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,100
recognized and just know this is also
 

713
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,530
recognized and just know this is also
manually and it would be nice if you

714
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:51,540
manually and it would be nice if you
 

715
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,210
manually and it would be nice if you
could have something where it tries to

716
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,220
could have something where it tries to
 

717
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,769
could have something where it tries to
generate a software configuration copy

718
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:54,779
generate a software configuration copy
 

719
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,389
generate a software configuration copy
this somehow back and then use that to

720
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
this somehow back and then use that to
 

721
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,069
this somehow back and then use that to
install the system so that would be

722
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
install the system so that would be
 

723
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,410
install the system so that would be
something nice to have in the future

724
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:00,420
something nice to have in the future
 

725
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,930
something nice to have in the future
see

726
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:02,940

 

727
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,329

yeah to summarize what we talked about

728
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:05,339
yeah to summarize what we talked about
 

729
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,269
yeah to summarize what we talked about
today we had a disco that you're used to

730
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:08,279
today we had a disco that you're used to
 

731
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,610
today we had a disco that you're used to
configure this and we talked about mixes

732
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:10,620
configure this and we talked about mixes
 

733
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,389
configure this and we talked about mixes
anywhere to install your Nexus was that

734
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
anywhere to install your Nexus was that
 

735

yeah that's it that's it if you've got
any questions uh time is now

746
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:30,550
any questions uh time is now
 

747
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:40,550
any questions uh time is now
[Applause]

748
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
[Applause]
 

749
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,370
[Applause]
how am I going to get that uh

750
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:46,380

 

751
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,829

thanks for the talk uh I have a question

752
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:48,839
thanks for the talk uh I have a question
 

753
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,150
thanks for the talk uh I have a question
about disco

754
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
about disco
 

755
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,870
about disco
um

756
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
um
 

757
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,210
um
I find that one of the most annoying

758
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:53,220
I find that one of the most annoying
 

759
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,030
I find that one of the most annoying
things what when what you do when you're

760
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,040
things what when what you do when you're
 

761
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,250
things what when what you do when you're
partition your disks is making sure that

762
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,260
partition your disks is making sure that
 

763
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,949
partition your disks is making sure that
your partitions are properly aligned uh

764
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
your partitions are properly aligned uh
 

765
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,569
your partitions are properly aligned uh
like it's things that you can

766
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:02,579
like it's things that you can
 

767
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,430
like it's things that you can
occasionally stumble on especially if

768
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:04,440
occasionally stumble on especially if
 

769
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,990
occasionally stumble on especially if
you're doing Zeta fast like if it's

770
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
you're doing Zeta fast like if it's
 

771
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,090
you're doing Zeta fast like if it's
slightly misaligned you get all kinds of

772
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,100
slightly misaligned you get all kinds of
 

773
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,430
slightly misaligned you get all kinds of
performance issues especially in ssds

774
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,440
performance issues especially in ssds
 

775
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,430
performance issues especially in ssds
does this could do any kind of specific

776
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
does this could do any kind of specific
 

777
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,650
does this could do any kind of specific
magic to make sure that your partitions

778
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:15,660
magic to make sure that your partitions
 

779
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,170
magic to make sure that your partitions
are aligned or at least warnings that

780
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,180
are aligned or at least warnings that
 

781
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,170
are aligned or at least warnings that
you are doing something very stupid no

782
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,180
you are doing something very stupid no
 

783
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,629
you are doing something very stupid no
but that could be a feature

784
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:23,639
but that could be a feature
 

785
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,970
but that could be a feature
I mean now you specify the sizes of each

786
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:25,980
I mean now you specify the sizes of each
 

787
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,650
I mean now you specify the sizes of each
partition right now you're basically

788
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:27,660
partition right now you're basically
 

789
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,569
partition right now you're basically
like

790
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:28,579
like
 

791
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,850
like
specify what SG should run and if

792
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:31,860
specify what SG should run and if
 

793
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,590
specify what SG should run and if
there's an sgdisk parameter to do this

794
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
there's an sgdisk parameter to do this
 

795
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,210
there's an sgdisk parameter to do this
automatically or one you then it would

796
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,220
automatically or one you then it would
 

797
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,970
automatically or one you then it would
do this yeah I think usually if you use

798
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:37,980
do this yeah I think usually if you use
 

799
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,090
do this yeah I think usually if you use
like a common sizes like one gigabyte or

800
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,100
like a common sizes like one gigabyte or
 

801
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,350
like a common sizes like one gigabyte or
something like that some then it's

802
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:42,360
something like that some then it's
 

803
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,449
something like that some then it's
already set of aligned yeah I think so

804
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:44,459
already set of aligned yeah I think so
 

805
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,750
already set of aligned yeah I think so
yeah but I'm not sure

806
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:47,760

 

807
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,150

yeah right okay yeah we could check that

808
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
yeah right okay yeah we could check that
 

809
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,250
yeah right okay yeah we could check that
but it's like yeah something we had to

810
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:52,260
but it's like yeah something we had to
 

811
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,569
but it's like yeah something we had to
implement right and the thing is that

812
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:53,579
implement right and the thing is that
 

813
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,310
implement right and the thing is that
sometimes there's actually use cases for

814
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,320
sometimes there's actually use cases for
 

815
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,710
sometimes there's actually use cases for
that I I know that some arm boards if

816
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:57,720
that I I know that some arm boards if
 

817
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,750
that I I know that some arm boards if
they want their bootloader really really

818
00:15:59,750 --> 00:15:59,760
they want their bootloader really really
 

819
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,550
they want their bootloader really really
odd locations and then you need some

820
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:01,560
odd locations and then you need some
 

821
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,629
odd locations and then you need some
alignment

822
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
alignment
 

823
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,970
alignment
um yeah yeah yeah maybe open an issue

824
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:04,980
um yeah yeah yeah maybe open an issue
 

825
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,430
um yeah yeah yeah maybe open an issue
and I will think about it all right I

826
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
and I will think about it all right I
 

827
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,250
and I will think about it all right I
will open the issue

828
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,260
will open the issue
 

829
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,530
will open the issue
I'm all the way back here

830
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:12,540
I'm all the way back here
 

831
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,930
I'm all the way back here
okay all right great talk thank you

832
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:14,940
okay all right great talk thank you
 

833
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,790
okay all right great talk thank you
um I have a question so from I

834
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
um I have a question so from I
 

835
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,530
um I have a question so from I
understand that this works in an online

836
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:18,540
understand that this works in an online
 

837
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,449
understand that this works in an online
environment so both machines have access

838
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:20,459
environment so both machines have access
 

839
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,430
environment so both machines have access
to the internet I'm wondering if there

840
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:22,440
to the internet I'm wondering if there
 

841
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,590
to the internet I'm wondering if there
is a method to install Nexus if the

842
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:24,600
is a method to install Nexus if the
 

843
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,210
is a method to install Nexus if the
machine B the target doesn't have

844
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,220
machine B the target doesn't have
 

845
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,090
machine B the target doesn't have
internet access so sort of prepare the

846
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,100
internet access so sort of prepare the
 

847
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,129
internet access so sort of prepare the
install on machine a ship it and install

848
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:31,139
install on machine a ship it and install
 

849
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,889
install on machine a ship it and install
it on the machine B

850
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:33,899
it on the machine B
 

851
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,170
it on the machine B
um so if I mean we we can support it

852
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,180
um so if I mean we we can support it
 

853
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,910
um so if I mean we we can support it
offline because we have an access test

854
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
offline because we have an access test
 

855
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,490
offline because we have an access test
that also doesn't have internet

856
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:40,500
that also doesn't have internet
 

857
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,949
that also doesn't have internet
um so you would need the next rest

858
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
um so you would need the next rest
 

859
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,810
um so you would need the next rest
closure already on the target from a

860
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:44,820
closure already on the target from a
 

861
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,449
closure already on the target from a
start installation and then the machine

862
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:47,459
start installation and then the machine
 

863
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,910
start installation and then the machine
that you know from firmware is starting

864
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
that you know from firmware is starting
 

865
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,170
that you know from firmware is starting
yeah from where you start installation

866
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,180
yeah from where you start installation
 

867
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,910
yeah from where you start installation
and then Target you install too it

868
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:52,920
and then Target you install too it
 

869
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,530
and then Target you install too it
doesn't need to have any internet access

870
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:54,540
doesn't need to have any internet access
 

871
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,810
doesn't need to have any internet access
indeed when I when I use the pixie boot

872
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:56,820
indeed when I when I use the pixie boot
 

873
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,210
indeed when I when I use the pixie boot
I never actually got configured any

874
00:16:59,210 --> 00:16:59,220
I never actually got configured any
 

875
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,910
I never actually got configured any
public internet on that it would just

876
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
public internet on that it would just
 

877
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,189
public internet on that it would just
copy everything from the installing

878
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:04,199
copy everything from the installing
 

879
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,530
copy everything from the installing
machine over

880
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:06,540
machine over
 

881
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,270
machine over
um so there's nothing special needed if

882
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:08,280
um so there's nothing special needed if
 

883
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,710
um so there's nothing special needed if
you have internet that's maybe faster if

884
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:09,720
you have internet that's maybe faster if
 

885
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,929
you have internet that's maybe faster if
the machine can use the binary cache to

886
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:11,939
the machine can use the binary cache to
 

887
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,789
the machine can use the binary cache to
download something from you from the

888
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:13,799
download something from you from the
 

889
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,710
download something from you from the
binary cache rather than you having to

890
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:15,720
binary cache rather than you having to
 

891
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,970
binary cache rather than you having to
upload everything but this is something

892
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:16,980
upload everything but this is something
 

893
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,789
upload everything but this is something
that is automatically said

894
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:19,799
that is automatically said
 

895
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,470
that is automatically said
now I'm literally all the way in the

896
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,480
now I'm literally all the way in the
 

897
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,870
now I'm literally all the way in the
front

898
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:23,880

 

899
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,449

thank you for your chunk I've uh already

900
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:26,459
thank you for your chunk I've uh already
 

901
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,150
thank you for your chunk I've uh already
used disco and Android it's a great deal

902
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,160
used disco and Android it's a great deal
 

903
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,470
used disco and Android it's a great deal
um

904
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
um
 

905
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,289
um
I'm wondering if you if you have any

906
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:33,299
I'm wondering if you if you have any
 

907
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,090
I'm wondering if you if you have any
ideas on how nixos anywhere could

908
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,100
ideas on how nixos anywhere could
 

909
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,250
ideas on how nixos anywhere could
support systems that have very little

910
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,260
support systems that have very little
 

911
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,029
support systems that have very little
Ram which can be an issue for the

912
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:40,039
Ram which can be an issue for the
 

913
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,010
Ram which can be an issue for the
sometimes quite sizable internet mfs's

914
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,020
sometimes quite sizable internet mfs's
 

915
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,029
sometimes quite sizable internet mfs's
that are used for kxx sort of stuff

916
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:46,039
that are used for kxx sort of stuff
 

917
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,090
that are used for kxx sort of stuff
yeah so yeah that's okay exec

918
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,100
yeah so yeah that's okay exec
 

919
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,770
yeah so yeah that's okay exec
um needs to load the whole install into

920
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:51,780
um needs to load the whole install into
 

921
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,370
um needs to load the whole install into
memory which is a tough call if you only

922
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:55,380
memory which is a tough call if you only
 

923
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,169
memory which is a tough call if you only
have one gigabyte of ram

924
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:57,179
have one gigabyte of ram
 

925
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,529
have one gigabyte of ram
um because Nexus has some size to the

926
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:00,539
um because Nexus has some size to the
 

927
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,750
um because Nexus has some size to the
various reason

928
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:02,760
various reason
 

929
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,029
various reason
um so the current recommendation is

930
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
um so the current recommendation is
 

931
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,890
um so the current recommendation is
either you find a way to actually boot

932
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:06,900
either you find a way to actually boot
 

933
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,630
either you find a way to actually boot
an exhaust installer because if it

934
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
an exhaust installer because if it
 

935
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,669
an exhaust installer because if it
detects in exist installer will not try

936
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:10,679
detects in exist installer will not try
 

937
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,350
detects in exist installer will not try
to kicks that it will just continuous

938
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:12,360
to kicks that it will just continuous
 

939
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,330
to kicks that it will just continuous
installation which is also nice if your

940
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:14,340
installation which is also nice if your
 

941
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,850
installation which is also nice if your
cakes if you install a failed because

942
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:16,860
cakes if you install a failed because
 

943
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,770
cakes if you install a failed because
you the machine doesn't actually reboot

944
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:18,780
you the machine doesn't actually reboot
 

945
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,409
you the machine doesn't actually reboot
you can just like retry

946
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:21,419
you can just like retry
 

947
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,890
you can just like retry
um uh yeah but then there's also there

948
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:24,900
um uh yeah but then there's also there
 

949
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,750
um uh yeah but then there's also there
was also another approach where we tried

950
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:26,760
was also another approach where we tried
 

951
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,750
was also another approach where we tried
to like uh someone try to use some as a

952
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
to like uh someone try to use some as a
 

953
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,850
to like uh someone try to use some as a
tool called mixed up by yeah as the

954
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:31,860
tool called mixed up by yeah as the
 

955
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,150
tool called mixed up by yeah as the
installer image so that was uh an

956
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,160
installer image so that was uh an
 

957
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,830
installer image so that was uh an
attempt to like reduce the inexor since

958
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:36,840
attempt to like reduce the inexor since
 

959
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,590
attempt to like reduce the inexor since
data and it uses this uh clever trick

960
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
data and it uses this uh clever trick
 

961
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,010
data and it uses this uh clever trick
that um we actually now use systemd and

962
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,020
that um we actually now use systemd and
 

963
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,230
that um we actually now use systemd and
also in in it ID so it would not

964
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:45,240
also in in it ID so it would not
 

965
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,650
also in in it ID so it would not
actually uh switch to a Nexus a normal

966
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:48,660
actually uh switch to a Nexus a normal
 

967
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,810
actually uh switch to a Nexus a normal
mix size it would just stay in this and

968
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:50,820
mix size it would just stay in this and
 

969
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,450
mix size it would just stay in this and
then use the smaller initiative and that

970
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:53,460
then use the smaller initiative and that
 

971
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,730
then use the smaller initiative and that
also helps to like bring down it to like

972
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:55,740
also helps to like bring down it to like
 

973
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,470
also helps to like bring down it to like
I don't know what the minimum size was I

974
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:57,480
I don't know what the minimum size was I
 

975
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,470
I don't know what the minimum size was I
think 50 megabytes yeah so that's quite

976
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
think 50 megabytes yeah so that's quite
 

977
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,150
think 50 megabytes yeah so that's quite
small I think if you have a machine that

978
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
small I think if you have a machine that
 

979
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,650
small I think if you have a machine that
is smaller than that you may be worried

980
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:03,660
is smaller than that you may be worried
 

981
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,510
is smaller than that you may be worried
about that all Unix workload might not

982
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
about that all Unix workload might not
 

983
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,130
about that all Unix workload might not
work either anyway

984
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,140
work either anyway
 

985
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,409
work either anyway
yeah

986
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:09,419
yeah
 

987
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,289
yeah
hey thanks for tools I really love them

988
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:12,299
hey thanks for tools I really love them
 

989
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,270
hey thanks for tools I really love them
um I know you had at a point a bit of

990
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,280
um I know you had at a point a bit of
 

991
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,950
um I know you had at a point a bit of
terraform configuration but you never

992
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:15,960
terraform configuration but you never
 

993
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,110
terraform configuration but you never
mentioned it here uh and I thought it

994
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,120
mentioned it here uh and I thought it
 

995
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,510
mentioned it here uh and I thought it
was a really cool integration uh that

996
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,520
was a really cool integration uh that
 

997
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,210
was a really cool integration uh that
makes Nexus anywhere spin up things

998
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:23,220
makes Nexus anywhere spin up things
 

999
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,029
makes Nexus anywhere spin up things
really easily but have you sort of given

1000
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:26,039
really easily but have you sort of given
 

1001
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,669
really easily but have you sort of given
up on that or are you still using it no

1002
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:28,679
up on that or are you still using it no
 

1003
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,830
up on that or are you still using it no
the I actually just updated the

1004
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:30,840
the I actually just updated the
 

1005
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,289
the I actually just updated the
terraform module last week I was adding

1006
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:33,299
terraform module last week I was adding
 

1007
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,289
terraform module last week I was adding
a secret support to that

1008
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:36,299
a secret support to that
 

1009
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,529
a secret support to that
um yeah I think it's like mainly I need

1010
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:39,539
um yeah I think it's like mainly I need
 

1011
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,930
um yeah I think it's like mainly I need
to like I mean we already tried to

1012
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:41,940
to like I mean we already tried to
 

1013
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,029
to like I mean we already tried to
document it everything quite well with

1014
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:44,039
document it everything quite well with
 

1015
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,529
document it everything quite well with
like a quick start guide and even if

1016
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:45,539
like a quick start guide and even if
 

1017
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,049
like a quick start guide and even if
you've not used Nexus that much that you

1018
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:48,059
you've not used Nexus that much that you
 

1019
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,150
you've not used Nexus that much that you
can get started using it over the

1020
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
can get started using it over the
 

1021
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,070
can get started using it over the
telephone code I haven't gotten a route

1022
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
telephone code I haven't gotten a route
 

1023
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,049
telephone code I haven't gotten a route
to like make a proper example what's

1024
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:54,059
to like make a proper example what's
 

1025
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,049
to like make a proper example what's
indeed quite nice it's just like one

1026
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:57,059
indeed quite nice it's just like one
 

1027
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,909
indeed quite nice it's just like one
module if you know if you're familiar

1028
00:19:58,909 --> 00:19:58,919
module if you know if you're familiar
 

1029
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,169
module if you know if you're familiar
with terraform

1030
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:00,179
with terraform
 

1031
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,390
with terraform
um where you can just pass in all the

1032
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
um where you can just pass in all the
 

1033
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,890
um where you can just pass in all the
arguments that you would specify on the

1034
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:03,900
arguments that you would specify on the
 

1035
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,990
arguments that you would specify on the
command line you specify to the module

1036
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
command line you specify to the module
 

1037
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,510
command line you specify to the module
and then it will run Nexus anywhere and

1038
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:08,520
and then it will run Nexus anywhere and
 

1039
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,789
and then it will run Nexus anywhere and
remember that

1040
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:09,799
remember that
 

1041
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,409
remember that
and it's quite also nice if you just

1042
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:12,419
and it's quite also nice if you just
 

1043
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,970
and it's quite also nice if you just
want to like have a quick installation

1044
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:13,980
want to like have a quick installation
 

1045
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,710
want to like have a quick installation
that you maybe kill later also because

1046
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:15,720
that you maybe kill later also because
 

1047
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,169
that you maybe kill later also because
you're just trying something out

1048
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:18,179
you're just trying something out
 

1049
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,390
you're just trying something out
um but so yeah it will stay supported uh

1050
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
um but so yeah it will stay supported uh
 

1051
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,390
um but so yeah it will stay supported uh
we have uses of that and yeah not not

1052
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,400
we have uses of that and yeah not not
 

1053
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,130
we have uses of that and yeah not not
going away

1054
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:25,140
going away
 

1055
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,750
going away
okay

1056
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:26,760
okay
 

1057
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,730
okay
hi

1058
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:28,740
hi
 

1059
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,610
hi
um is there a plan to support something

1060
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:31,620
um is there a plan to support something
 

1061
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,029
um is there a plan to support something
like uh using disco on a running system

1062
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
like uh using disco on a running system
 

1063
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,610
like uh using disco on a running system
at the moment it's for installing only

1064
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:37,620
at the moment it's for installing only
 

1065
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:44,289
at the moment it's for installing only
for example for CFS to deploy a kind of

1066
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:44,299
for example for CFS to deploy a kind of
 

1067
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,810
for example for CFS to deploy a kind of
data sets with special options or

1068
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:47,820
data sets with special options or
 

1069
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,510
data sets with special options or
something like that to have it in a

1070
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:50,520
something like that to have it in a
 

1071
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,730
something like that to have it in a
declarative way

1072
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:52,740
declarative way
 

1073
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,370
declarative way
on my system

1074
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:55,380
on my system
 

1075
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,590
on my system
so just go I will configure your file

1076
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
so just go I will configure your file
 

1077
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,029
so just go I will configure your file
systems and stuff but it won't create

1078
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
systems and stuff but it won't create
 

1079
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,250
systems and stuff but it won't create
new data sets right now but it's on the

1080
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:01,260
new data sets right now but it's on the
 

1081
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,470
new data sets right now but it's on the
agenda so I want to like implement the

1082
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:03,480
agenda so I want to like implement the
 

1083
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,690
agenda so I want to like implement the
stage transitions so if you have like if

1084
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:05,700
stage transitions so if you have like if
 

1085
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,549
stage transitions so if you have like if
your disco config changes and the up the

1086
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:07,559
your disco config changes and the up the
 

1087
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,169
your disco config changes and the up the
changes are non-destructive like it

1088
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:09,179
changes are non-destructive like it
 

1089
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,330
changes are non-destructive like it
would do those but it's not done yet

1090
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:11,340
would do those but it's not done yet
 

1091
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,630
would do those but it's not done yet
it's like end of the year thing it's

1092
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
it's like end of the year thing it's
 

1093
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,549
it's like end of the year thing it's
super hard to have this problem because

1094
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
super hard to have this problem because
 

1095
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,049
super hard to have this problem because
at the end this course also just uh

1096
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:20,059
at the end this course also just uh
 

1097
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:24,169
at the end this course also just uh
shell script generator sort of uh so

1098
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:24,179
shell script generator sort of uh so
 

1099
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:25,990
shell script generator sort of uh so
it's like the rest of Nick's

1100
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
it's like the rest of Nick's
 

1101
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,510
it's like the rest of Nick's
is just bash scripts here basically best

1102
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
is just bash scripts here basically best
 

1103
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:38,510
is just bash scripts here basically best
script templating yeah the power of Nyx

1104
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:38,520

 

1105
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,130

any more questions

1106
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,140
any more questions
 

1107
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:47,690
any more questions
foreign

1108
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:47,700

 

1109
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,890

you sure

1110
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:51,900

 

1111
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,270

what would it take to get it into next

1112
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
what would it take to get it into next
 

1113
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,830
what would it take to get it into next
West as the default installer

1114
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
West as the default installer
 

1115
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,330
West as the default installer
what would it take to get it into nixos

1116
00:21:59,330 --> 00:21:59,340
what would it take to get it into nixos
 

1117
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,210
what would it take to get it into nixos
as a default installer first we have to

1118
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,220
as a default installer first we have to
 

1119
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,270
as a default installer first we have to
merge disco I guess yeah getting to yeah

1120
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,280
merge disco I guess yeah getting to yeah
 

1121
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,250
merge disco I guess yeah getting to yeah
we would first need to get this code

1122
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,260
we would first need to get this code
 

1123
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,310
we would first need to get this code
into it because uh you're you're making

1124
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
into it because uh you're you're making
 

1125
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,810
into it because uh you're you're making
this part of an access configuration and

1126
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:11,820
this part of an access configuration and
 

1127
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,549
this part of an access configuration and
you have like an exhaust module where it

1128
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:13,559
you have like an exhaust module where it
 

1129
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,330
you have like an exhaust module where it
learns about the descriptions

1130
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:17,340
learns about the descriptions
 

1131
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,190
learns about the descriptions
um I think next was anywhere I could

1132
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
um I think next was anywhere I could
 

1133
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,710
um I think next was anywhere I could
package actually that's even the

1134
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:21,720
package actually that's even the
 

1135
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,289
package actually that's even the
independently of that uh it's just a

1136
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:24,299
independently of that uh it's just a
 

1137
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,529
independently of that uh it's just a

it would be not even a particular of
 

1141
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,950
it would be not even a particular of
complex package I don't know what I have

1142
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
complex package I don't know what I have
 

1143
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,470
complex package I don't know what I have
not done yet

1144
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480

1154
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:49,559
basic support could I like for example
 

1155
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:53,149
basic support could I like for example
use a UB key to unlock my disk and yeah

express we have a report module in nixos

1186
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,360
express we have a report module in nixos
 

1187
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,169
express we have a report module in nixos
in the next release that you can use uh

1188
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:27,179
in the next release that you can use uh
 

1189
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,210
in the next release that you can use uh
we added that but it would be nice if we

1190
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,220
we added that but it would be nice if we
 

1191
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,010
we added that but it would be nice if we
could collaborate make be making a

1192
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,020
could collaborate make be making a
 

1193
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,710
could collaborate make be making a
uniform module interface that they use

1194
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:33,720
uniform module interface that they use
 

1195
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,390
uniform module interface that they use
the same options all right and then

1196
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:35,400
the same options all right and then
 

1197
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,890
the same options all right and then
people can choose whatever they want

1198
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:36,900
people can choose whatever they want
 

1199
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,190
people can choose whatever they want
okay yeah the question is does repot

1200
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,200
okay yeah the question is does repot
 

1201
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,630
okay yeah the question is does repot
actually support everything we have

1202
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:41,640
actually support everything we have
 

1203
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,110
actually support everything we have
because otherwise no yeah it's a subset

1204
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
because otherwise no yeah it's a subset
 

1205
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,730
because otherwise no yeah it's a subset
of what you support I think yeah

1206
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:49,740

 

1207
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,049

yeah

1208
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:51,059
yeah
 

1209
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,390
yeah
so yeah if like repot only does this

1210
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,400
so yeah if like repot only does this
 

1211
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,110
so yeah if like repot only does this
stuff

1212
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,120
stuff
 

1213
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,789
stuff
or if you're doing disco only the stuff

1214
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:55,799
or if you're doing disco only the stuff
 

1215
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,529
or if you're doing disco only the stuff
that repart you support we could like

1216
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:57,539
that repart you support we could like
 

1217
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,330
that repart you support we could like
generate a report config out of it I

1218
00:23:59,330 --> 00:23:59,340
generate a report config out of it I
 

1219
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,789
generate a report config out of it I
guess but it's hard like to detect what

1220
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:01,799
guess but it's hard like to detect what
 

1221
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,590
guess but it's hard like to detect what
what if you have a feature that's repot

1222
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
what if you have a feature that's repot
 

1223
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,690
what if you have a feature that's repot
doesn't support but it's also on the

1224
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:05,700
doesn't support but it's also on the
 

1225
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,789
doesn't support but it's also on the
agenda not very high priority because it

1226
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:07,799
agenda not very high priority because it
 

1227
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:19,490
agenda not very high priority because it
works right now over here

1228
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:19,500

 

1229
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,590

um it seems you're in favor of set FS

no I don't think I don't think raid 5

1288
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:30,419
no I don't think I don't think raid 5
 

1289
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,090
no I don't think I don't think raid 5
works in Big better fast in the first

1290
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,100
works in Big better fast in the first
 

1291
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,890
works in Big better fast in the first
place so maybe we should actually

1292
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:33,900
place so maybe we should actually
 

1293
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,870
place so maybe we should actually
yeah yeah

1294
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:35,880
yeah yeah
 

1295
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,269
yeah yeah

00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
yeah
 

1297
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,890
yeah
it's just thought in memory and so for

1298
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:39,900
it's just thought in memory and so for
 

1299
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,570
it's just thought in memory and so for
the best but the Battle of s only works

1300
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,580
the best but the Battle of s only works
 

1301
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,130
the best but the Battle of s only works
with one single disk right now it's like

1302
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,140
with one single disk right now it's like
 

1303
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,950
with one single disk right now it's like
no no multi-disc type so because no one

1304
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:45,960
no no multi-disc type so because no one
 

1305
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,250
no no multi-disc type so because no one
I know uses that yeah you shouldn't I

1306
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,260
I know uses that yeah you shouldn't I
 

1307
00:25:49,260 --> 00:26:00,529
I know uses that yeah you shouldn't I
think yeah but we could allow it like

1308
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:00,539

 

1309
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,590

no no I'm the best script developer oh

1310
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:03,600
no no I'm the best script developer oh
 

1311
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,100
no no I'm the best script developer oh
yeah okay

1312
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,110
yeah okay
 

1313
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,710

arrange that the speakers would speak

1320
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
arrange that the speakers would speak
 

1321
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,350
arrange that the speakers would speak
faster so you guys can ask more

1322
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
faster so you guys can ask more
 

1323
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,730
faster so you guys can ask more
questions so that I have to distribute

1324
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:16,740
questions so that I have to distribute
 

1325
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,390
questions so that I have to distribute
more Parks yes that's the case okay

1326
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
more Parks yes that's the case okay
 

1327
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,610
more Parks yes that's the case okay
round

1328
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:21,620
round
 

1329
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:31,909
round
but that's good

1330
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919

I wanted to start by saying thank you
 

1333
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,529
I wanted to start by saying thank you
for the awesome tool talk and also the

1334
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:36,539
for the awesome tool talk and also the
 

1335
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,810

weekly merge meetings you guys hold you

1336
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:38,820
weekly merge meetings you guys hold you
 

1337
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,750
weekly merge meetings you guys hold you
might recognize my voice

1338
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:40,760
might recognize my voice
 

1339
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,310
might recognize my voice
I was wondering of course you have real

1340
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,320
I was wondering of course you have real
 

1341
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,409
I was wondering of course you have real
life considerations outside of just

1342
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:45,419
life considerations outside of just
 

1343
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,710
life considerations outside of just
Nick's interests what would be a

1344
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
Nick's interests what would be a
 

1345
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,710
Nick's interests what would be a
somewhat expected time scale for more

1346
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:51,720
somewhat expected time scale for more
 

1347
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,590
somewhat expected time scale for more
CFS features and the

1348
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:54,600
CFS features and the
 

1349
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,289
CFS features and the
disco not having to recreate this from

1350
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:57,299
disco not having to recreate this from
 

1351
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:02,990
disco not having to recreate this from
scratch every time

1352
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,000

 

1353
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,510

I think we got like a thread for setup

1354
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
I think we got like a thread for setup
 

1355
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,250
I think we got like a thread for setup
first where people like propose a lot of

1356
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:07,260
first where people like propose a lot of
 

1357
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,769
first where people like propose a lot of
things you need to add uh has like an

1358
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:09,779
things you need to add uh has like an
 

1359
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,149
things you need to add uh has like an
issue where people are like talking

1360
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:11,159
issue where people are like talking
 

1361
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,010
issue where people are like talking
about the schema we want to Define like

1362
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,020
about the schema we want to Define like
 

1363
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,990
about the schema we want to Define like
we just have to implement it now this is

1364
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,000
we just have to implement it now this is
 

1365
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,330
we just have to implement it now this is
schema already know I think it is but

1366
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:17,340
schema already know I think it is but
 

1367
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,010
schema already know I think it is but
people people should take a look do you

1368
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,020
people people should take a look do you
 

1369
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,350
people people should take a look do you
use Advanced database features yeah so

1370
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
use Advanced database features yeah so
 

1371
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,269
use Advanced database features yeah so
they said for set of us there's like a

1372
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:23,279
they said for set of us there's like a
 

1373
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,490
they said for set of us there's like a
thread where you can see what option uh

1374
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:25,500
thread where you can see what option uh
 

1375
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,890
thread where you can see what option uh
What uh what people want to have and if

1376
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:27,900
What uh what people want to have and if
 

1377
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,269
What uh what people want to have and if
we have the next configuration then

1378
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
we have the next configuration then
 

1379
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,130
we have the next configuration then
let's just make it a purchase script

1380
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:31,140
let's just make it a purchase script
 

1381
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,649
let's just make it a purchase script
somehow and yeah and for the other thing

1382
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:33,659
somehow and yeah and for the other thing
 

1383
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,470
somehow and yeah and for the other thing
was first incremental stuff yeah I I

1384
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
was first incremental stuff yeah I I
 

1385
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,450
was first incremental stuff yeah I I
have some there's also an issue about

1386
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:38,460
have some there's also an issue about
 

1387
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,549
have some there's also an issue about
that where I talked about the ideas so

1388
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
that where I talked about the ideas so
 

1389
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,409
that where I talked about the ideas so
it would be like a check face where you

1390
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:42,419
it would be like a check face where you
 

1391
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,870
it would be like a check face where you
like check the current state and do the

1392
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
like check the current state and do the
 

1393
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,630
like check the current state and do the
stuff if that's like okay to do without

1394
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:47,640
stuff if that's like okay to do without
 

1395
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,950
stuff if that's like okay to do without
destroying anything

1396
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
destroying anything
 

1397
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,049
destroying anything
I haven't put deep thought into it yet

1398
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:54,059

 

1399
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,690

hi so um

1400
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:56,700
hi so um
 

1401
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,049
hi so um
you configure your disk labels with the

1402
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:00,059
you configure your disk labels with the
 

1403
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,690
you configure your disk labels with the
Disco is there any integration with the

1404
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:02,700
Disco is there any integration with the
 

1405
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,970
Disco is there any integration with the
Nyx OS configuration to make sure that

1406
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:04,980
Nyx OS configuration to make sure that
 

1407
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,490
Nyx OS configuration to make sure that
the disk labels you configure for the

1408
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:07,500
the disk labels you configure for the
 

1409
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,529
the disk labels you configure for the
file systems match up with what you've

1410
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:09,539
file systems match up with what you've
 

1411
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,350
file systems match up with what you've
configured in Disco yes if you use the

1412
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:12,360
configured in Disco yes if you use the
 

1413
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,230
configured in Disco yes if you use the
new GPT table type it also it also

1414
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:15,240
new GPT table type it also it also
 

1415
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,970
new GPT table type it also it also
generates a labels also for you already

1416
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:16,980
generates a labels also for you already
 

1417
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,810
generates a labels also for you already
are we talking about the sacrifices

1418
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:19,820
are we talking about the sacrifices
 

1419
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,549
are we talking about the sacrifices
like it's like part labels yes yeah yeah

1420
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:22,559
like it's like part labels yes yeah yeah
 

1421
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,390
like it's like part labels yes yeah yeah
so actually we interpret here we use a

1422
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,400
so actually we interpret here we use a
 

1423
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,730
so actually we interpret here we use a
feature of GPT of the and put the labels

1424
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:28,740
feature of GPT of the and put the labels
 

1425
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,750
feature of GPT of the and put the labels
there and there's also file system

1426
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
there and there's also file system
 

1427
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,370
there and there's also file system
labels yeah but we don't use that we

1428
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:31,380
labels yeah but we don't use that we
 

1429
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,370
labels yeah but we don't use that we
don't use labels

1430
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:33,380
don't use labels
 

1431
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,529
don't use labels
uniform yeah then we don't need to check

1432
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:36,539
uniform yeah then we don't need to check
 

1433
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,909
uniform yeah then we don't need to check
for the first systems which was easier

1434
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
for the first systems which was easier
 

1435
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,649
for the first systems which was easier
to implement

1436
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:41,659

 

1437
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:44,690

it's the second time I had to go back to

1438
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:44,700
it's the second time I had to go back to
 

1439
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,570
it's the second time I had to go back to
get more Parks so can it can work off

1440
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:47,580
get more Parks so can it can work off
 

1441
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,310
get more Parks so can it can work off
the calories from drinking all the club

1442
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,320
the calories from drinking all the club
 

1443
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,830
the calories from drinking all the club
matter oh that that's good I don't mind

1444
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
matter oh that that's good I don't mind
 

1445
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,149
matter oh that that's good I don't mind
that

1446
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:55,159

 

1447
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,930

uh hi so in general installing next to

1448
00:28:59,930 --> 00:28:59,940
uh hi so in general installing next to
 

1449
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,130
uh hi so in general installing next to
us on anything but not x86 so like onto

1450
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:04,140
us on anything but not x86 so like onto
 

1451
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,830
us on anything but not x86 so like onto
arm boards especially if nexo has

1452
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:06,840
arm boards especially if nexo has
 

1453
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,070
arm boards especially if nexo has
installed if one decides to mount the SD

1454
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,080
installed if one decides to mount the SD
 

1455
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,190
installed if one decides to mount the SD
card onto the main computer and then try

1456
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
card onto the main computer and then try
 

1457
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,470
card onto the main computer and then try
to use bin fmd breaks almost every

1458
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,480
to use bin fmd breaks almost every
 

1459
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,570
to use bin fmd breaks almost every
single time uh so with next OS anywhere

1460
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:20,580
single time uh so with next OS anywhere
 

1461
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,330
single time uh so with next OS anywhere
because you mentioned disk images does

1462
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:23,340
because you mentioned disk images does
 

1463
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,669
because you mentioned disk images does
that work nicely from an x86 machine

1464
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
that work nicely from an x86 machine
 

1465
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,289
that work nicely from an x86 machine
creating a disk image for a arm machine

1466
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:29,299
creating a disk image for a arm machine
 

1467
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:32,870
creating a disk image for a arm machine
and then putting that on the SD card

1468
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
and then putting that on the SD card
 

1469
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,110
and then putting that on the SD card
I haven't tested it yet I think well I

1470
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,120
I haven't tested it yet I think well I
 

1471
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,029
I haven't tested it yet I think well I
guess either you have like native cross

1472
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:38,039
guess either you have like native cross
 

1473
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,029
guess either you have like native cross
compilation with pin fmt with all before

1474
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039
compilation with pin fmt with all before
 

1475
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,610
compilation with pin fmt with all before
you use the benefits I think bin fmt

1476
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:43,620
you use the benefits I think bin fmt
 

1477
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,289
you use the benefits I think bin fmt
might be actually fine because you're

1478
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:45,299
might be actually fine because you're
 

1479
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,330
might be actually fine because you're
only copying stuff uh yeah if you have a

1480
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:47,340
only copying stuff uh yeah if you have a
 

1481
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,630
only copying stuff uh yeah if you have a
binary cache yeah yeah but we do expose

1482
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
binary cache yeah yeah but we do expose
 

1483
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,190
binary cache yeah yeah but we do expose
all the options that you need to like

1484
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:52,200
all the options that you need to like
 

1485
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,250
all the options that you need to like
change uh

1486
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:55,260
change uh
 

1487
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,250
change uh
I haven't tested this yet I have a

1488
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,260
I haven't tested this yet I have a
 

1489
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,409
I haven't tested this yet I have a
Raspberry Pi on my desk so also clear

1490
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:00,419
Raspberry Pi on my desk so also clear
 

1491
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,529
Raspberry Pi on my desk so also clear
maybe yes I have the experience that

1492
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:03,539
maybe yes I have the experience that
 

1493
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,850
maybe yes I have the experience that
next to us install really likes because

1494
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:07,860
next to us install really likes because
 

1495
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,230
next to us install really likes because
so you have to put bin fmt if I remember

1496
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
so you have to put bin fmt if I remember
 

1497
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,230
so you have to put bin fmt if I remember
correctly in slash run and then next to

1498
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:15,240
correctly in slash run and then next to
 

1499
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,810
correctly in slash run and then next to
us install likes to just kind of clean

1500
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:17,820
us install likes to just kind of clean
 

1501
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,029
us install likes to just kind of clean
Flash run up and break with empty

1502
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:20,039
Flash run up and break with empty
 

1503
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,210
Flash run up and break with empty
halfway uh so it's something I've

1504
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,220
halfway uh so it's something I've
 

1505
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,190
halfway uh so it's something I've
experienced So currently I think

1506
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
experienced So currently I think
 

1507
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,350
experienced So currently I think
currently it spawns a virtual machine

1508
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
currently it spawns a virtual machine
 

1509
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,110
currently it spawns a virtual machine
anyway for creating this

1510
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,120
anyway for creating this
 

1511
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,630
anyway for creating this
yes yes

1512
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:31,640
yes yes
 

1513
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,130
yes yes
so I think the best way would be if you

1514
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,140
so I think the best way would be if you
 

1515
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,930
so I think the best way would be if you
would just like make sure we actually

1516
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:35,940
would just like make sure we actually
 

1517
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,090
would just like make sure we actually
like if you if you're doing a cross

1518
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,100
like if you if you're doing a cross
 

1519
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,230
like if you if you're doing a cross
build that we then it's been armed 64.

1520
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
build that we then it's been armed 64.
 

1521
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,389
build that we then it's been armed 64.
Linux I think it's not I don't think it

1522
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:44,399
Linux I think it's not I don't think it
 

1523
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,190
Linux I think it's not I don't think it
works quite well yet just now probably

1524
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,200
works quite well yet just now probably
 

1525
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,289
works quite well yet just now probably
not but we we should check that yeah I

1526
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:48,299
not but we we should check that yeah I
 

1527
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,149
not but we we should check that yeah I
think it's feasible it's not like out of

1528
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
think it's feasible it's not like out of
 

1529
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,630
think it's feasible it's not like out of
yeah that's something

1530
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
yeah that's something
 

1531
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,730
yeah that's something
probably yeah

1532
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:58,740

 

1533
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,409

okay

1534
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:00,419
okay
 

1535
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,269
okay
oh I guess

1536
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:02,279
oh I guess
 

1537
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,930
oh I guess
anyone else we still have time

1538
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:05,940

 

1539
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,970

all right yep

1540
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:10,980

 

1541
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,130

fill up this time

1542
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,140
fill up this time
 

1543
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,250
fill up this time
um is it possible to uh for the CFS

1544
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,260
um is it possible to uh for the CFS
 

1545
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,630
um is it possible to uh for the CFS
Fanboys to

1546
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
Fanboys to
 

1547
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,970
Fanboys to
start or to have two disk mirrored disk

1548
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:27,980
start or to have two disk mirrored disk
 

1549
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,450
start or to have two disk mirrored disk
and booting if without grub with

1550
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:32,460
and booting if without grub with
 

1551
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,610
and booting if without grub with
something like system deepwood

1552
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:34,620
something like system deepwood
 

1553
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,149
something like system deepwood
and have an encrypted CFS that should be

1554
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
and have an encrypted CFS that should be
 

1555
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,430
and have an encrypted CFS that should be
possible yeah I set this up just

1556
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:40,440
possible yeah I set this up just
 

1557
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,470
possible yeah I set this up just
recently like uh the problem is the boot

1558
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
recently like uh the problem is the boot
 

1559
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,669
recently like uh the problem is the boot
partition because you need the API

1560
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:43,679
partition because you need the API
 

1561
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,010
partition because you need the API
partition and you would either put this

1562
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,020
partition and you would either put this
 

1563
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,269
partition and you would either put this
in the into an ad and the ADM rate with

1564
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:50,279
in the into an ad and the ADM rate with
 

1565
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,690
in the into an ad and the ADM rate with
metadata 1.0 so but then system Depot it

1566
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:53,700
metadata 1.0 so but then system Depot it
 

1567
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,889
metadata 1.0 so but then system Depot it
doesn't work because it doesn't like to

1568
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:54,899
doesn't work because it doesn't like to
 

1569
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,169
doesn't work because it doesn't like to
install to this yeah so it's a hard part

1570
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:57,179
install to this yeah so it's a hard part
 

1571
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:58,850
install to this yeah so it's a hard part
is actually convincing system do you put

1572
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:58,860
is actually convincing system do you put
 

1573
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,649
is actually convincing system do you put
if I have a rate system so like actually

1574
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:00,659
if I have a rate system so like actually
 

1575
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:03,230
if I have a rate system so like actually
like uh you cannot really install it

1576
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:03,240
like uh you cannot really install it
 

1577
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,350
like uh you cannot really install it
like like two uh put politicians it

1578
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:06,360
like like two uh put politicians it
 

1579
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,490
like like two uh put politicians it
doesn't like if you have to put

1580
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,500
doesn't like if you have to put
 

1581
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,350
doesn't like if you have to put
politicians like on different discs it

1582
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,360
politicians like on different discs it
 

1583
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,970
politicians like on different discs it
doesn't like if like the wood partition

1584
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:10,980
doesn't like if like the wood partition
 

1585
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,529
doesn't like if like the wood partition
is like on the red because it says it's

1586
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:12,539
is like on the red because it says it's
 

1587
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,350
is like on the red because it says it's
not a real file system yeah it's also

1588
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
not a real file system yeah it's also
 

1589
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,269
not a real file system yeah it's also
this and recruit crab works with that so

1590
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:17,279
this and recruit crab works with that so
 

1591
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,549
this and recruit crab works with that so
you I would say crop is currently the

1592
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:19,559
you I would say crop is currently the
 

1593
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,710
you I would say crop is currently the
better option for this setup uh so I'm

1594
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:21,720
better option for this setup uh so I'm
 

1595
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,409
better option for this setup uh so I'm
actually using the mirror boot option uh

1596
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:24,419
actually using the mirror boot option uh
 

1597
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:25,850
actually using the mirror boot option uh
for that crop house and I think there

1598
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:25,860
for that crop house and I think there
 

1599
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,230
for that crop house and I think there
was someone that tried to implement it

1600
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,240
was someone that tried to implement it
 

1601
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,789
was someone that tried to implement it
for system Depot as well yeah right to
