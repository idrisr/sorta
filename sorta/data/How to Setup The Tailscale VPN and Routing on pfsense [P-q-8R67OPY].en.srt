later in the video but for the most part

later in the video but for the most part
 

357
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,749
later in the video but for the most part
it's relatively easy to set up it's easy

it's relatively easy to set up it's easy
 

359
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,990
it's relatively easy to set up it's easy
to add these devices and we'll start by

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
to add these devices and we'll start by
 

361
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,430
to add these devices and we'll start by
deleting a device because we already

deleting a device because we already
have this one configured but we're going

have this one configured but we're going
to delete my pfsense lab and show you

to delete my pfsense lab and show you
 

367
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,749
to delete my pfsense lab and show you
how to add apf sense to it that part's

how to add apf sense to it that part's
 

369
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,670
how to add apf sense to it that part's
really simple and pretty easy to get

sense so now tail scale is not running

380
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,469

and don't worry these keys aren't

reusable but this is all a demo account
anyways so we've gone into tail scale

386
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
anyways so we've gone into tail scale
 

387
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,390
anyways so we've gone into tail scale
and we leave this the same this is what

388
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
and we leave this the same this is what
 

389
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,670
and we leave this the same this is what
you would change if you were using

390
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
you would change if you were using
 

391
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,110
you would change if you were using
something other than tail scale such as

392
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
something other than tail scale such as
 

393
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,950
something other than tail scale such as
head scales a coordination server so you

394
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
head scales a coordination server so you
 

395
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,550
head scales a coordination server so you
leave the login server the same and you

396
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
leave the login server the same and you
 

397
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,270
leave the login server the same and you
just put in the pre-authorization key

398
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
just put in the pre-authorization key
 

399
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,990
just put in the pre-authorization key
so right now status is not running so we

400
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
so right now status is not running so we
 

401
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,029
so right now status is not running so we
look at the settings even though it's

402
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
look at the settings even though it's
 

403
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,629
look at the settings even though it's
enabled tail scale is not working

404
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
enabled tail scale is not working
 

405
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,110
enabled tail scale is not working
because we forced a log out and clean

406
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
because we forced a log out and clean
 

407
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,790
because we forced a log out and clean
now if we go back over to tail scale and

408
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
now if we go back over to tail scale and
 

409
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,150
now if we go back over to tail scale and
look at the machines

410
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
look at the machines
 

411
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,670

you can see that it's offline so we'll

you can see that it's offline so we'll

you can see that it's offline so we'll
go ahead and just delete it so this is

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,990
going to so by doing this we don't have
to put any special outbound net rules i

636
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
to put any special outbound net rules i
 

637
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,389
to put any special outbound net rules i
only had to put in this route that

638
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
only had to put in this route that
 

639
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,389
only had to put in this route that
already belongs to this network and say

640
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
already belongs to this network and say
 

641
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,230
already belongs to this network and say
hey advertise this route if i wanted

642
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
hey advertise this route if i wanted
 

643
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,389
hey advertise this route if i wanted
more you can advertise several different

644
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
more you can advertise several different
 

645
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,670
more you can advertise several different
routes the only thing i really want

646
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
routes the only thing i really want
 

647
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,230
routes the only thing i really want
access to is things on the 192.1680

648
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
access to is things on the 192.1680

651
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,110
network it's called nsfw lan i have a
video about setting up pf sense and i've

652
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
video about setting up pf sense and i've
 

653
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,030
video about setting up pf sense and i've
covered why i call it that but

654
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
covered why i call it that but
 

655
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,949
covered why i call it that but
essentially it's my untrusted network of

00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
mentioned here we have the mb server or
 

661
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,509
mentioned here we have the mb server or
the trunas server now let's talk about

662
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
the trunas server now let's talk about
 

663
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,190
the trunas server now let's talk about
pinging that server and this is the 192

664
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
pinging that server and this is the 192

so this is my little ubuntu lab server

668
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
so this is my little ubuntu lab server
 

669
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,430
so this is my little ubuntu lab server
it's actually remote it is not local to

it's actually remote it is not local to
 

671
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,829
it's actually remote it is not local to
me you can see it's not a 10 dot network

672
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
me you can see it's not a 10 dot network
 

673
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,590
me you can see it's not a 10 dot network
and this network exists actually over at

00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
and this network exists actually over at
 

675
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,230
and this network exists actually over at
my office and tail scale is facilitating

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
my office and tail scale is facilitating
 

677
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,150
my office and tail scale is facilitating

this individual device connecting
 

679
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,550
this individual device connecting
through a tailed out coordination server

680
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
through a tailed out coordination server
 

681
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,870
through a tailed out coordination server
and then getting connected to my pf

682
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
and then getting connected to my pf
 

683
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,630
and then getting connected to my pf
sense and then having access to the

684
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
sense and then having access to the
 

685
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,790
sense and then having access to the
routes so we can do things like ping 192

686
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
routes so we can do things like ping 192
 

687
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,069
routes so we can do things like ping 192

easy enough to ping it or dot 30 which

692
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
easy enough to ping it or dot 30 which
 

693
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,230
easy enough to ping it or dot 30 which
is the mb server

694
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
is the mb server
 

695
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,230
is the mb server
now this is where things get a little

696
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
now this is where things get a little
 

697
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,350
now this is where things get a little
tricky and i want to talk about the

698
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
tricky and i want to talk about the
 

699
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,190
tricky and i want to talk about the
security concerns of this

700
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
security concerns of this
 

701
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,790
security concerns of this
if we go under firewall then rules

702
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
if we go under firewall then rules
 

703
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,790
if we go under firewall then rules
please note there are no rules here

under tail scale

706
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
under tail scale
 

707
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,470
under tail scale
let me explain the reason we're able to

708
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
let me explain the reason we're able to
 

709
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,470
let me explain the reason we're able to
and we'll go ahead and open up pf top

710
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
and we'll go ahead and open up pf top
 

711
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,030
and we'll go ahead and open up pf top
and we'll filter for host 192.168.1

712
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040

 

713
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,710

and then we're going to go and ping it

714
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
and then we're going to go and ping it
 

715
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,590
and then we're going to go and ping it
again if we ping 192 168.1.8

716
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
again if we ping 192 168.1.8
 

717
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,470
again if we ping 192 168.1.8
you'll see the icmp packets coming from

718
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:53,480
you'll see the icmp packets coming from
 

719
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,269
you'll see the icmp packets coming from
192.168.11 and the reason why is because

720
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
192.168.11 and the reason why is because
 

721
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,430
192.168.11 and the reason why is because
the way freebsd is going to handle the

722
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
the way freebsd is going to handle the
 

723
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,430
the way freebsd is going to handle the
routing is it's going to send a packet

724
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
routing is it's going to send a packet
 

725
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,230
routing is it's going to send a packet
from the subnet by which there is the

726
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
from the subnet by which there is the
 

727
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,829
from the subnet by which there is the
most direct path which is going to be

728
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
most direct path which is going to be
 

729
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,670
most direct path which is going to be
192.168.11.

730
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
192.168.11.
 

731
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,190
192.168.11.
the routing is being handled internally

732
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
the routing is being handled internally
 

733
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,590
the routing is being handled internally
by pf sense so by me pinging even though

734
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
by pf sense so by me pinging even though
 

735
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,430
by pf sense so by me pinging even though
my origination ip address is this one

736
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
my origination ip address is this one
 

737
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,590
my origination ip address is this one
here the 198 72.110

739
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,990
here the 198 72.110
that ip address isn't going to show up

740
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
that ip address isn't going to show up
 

741

inside of here that ip address
so if we go back to painting it is not

744
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
so if we go back to painting it is not
 

745
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,430
so if we go back to painting it is not

tailscale might be a little confusing

750
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
tailscale might be a little confusing
 

751
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,110
tailscale might be a little confusing
but it's something to think about that

752
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
but it's something to think about that
 

753
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,670
but it's something to think about that
the firewall rules do not apply to this

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
the firewall rules do not apply to this
 

755
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,750
the firewall rules do not apply to this
traffic because it's handled inside a pf

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,590
would need those acl rules that being
said what traffic is handled that way

762
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
said what traffic is handled that way
 

763
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,670
said what traffic is handled that way
and that traffic is going to be mypf

772
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
web interface there's no response so
 

773
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,629

let's go ahead and add a rule under tail

774
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
let's go ahead and add a rule under tail
 

775
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,470
let's go ahead and add a rule under tail

hit apply
 

787
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,910
hit apply
go back over here and now we can ping

788
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
go back over here and now we can ping
 

789
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,389
go back over here and now we can ping

so it doesn't need any rules for this
