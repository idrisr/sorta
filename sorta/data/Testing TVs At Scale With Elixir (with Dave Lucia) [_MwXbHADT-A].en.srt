they just wrapped a crummy browser but

376
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
they just wrapped a crummy browser but
 

377
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,629
they just wrapped a crummy browser but
what's give me a bit of an insight into

luckily uh most of it is web technology

384
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:25,560
luckily uh most of it is web technology
 

385
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,029
luckily uh most of it is web technology
and most of it is wrapping chromium and

386
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:28,039
and most of it is wrapping chromium and
 

387
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,350
and most of it is wrapping chromium and
and putting it into a t ision um the

388
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
and putting it into a t ision um the
 

389
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,430
and putting it into a t ision um the
problem is which crappy browser are they

390
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
problem is which crappy browser are they

putting into the television is the
question and uh you know these things I

of every platform what I can tell you is
 

401
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,190
of every platform what I can tell you is
that most of these platforms are

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,200
that most of these platforms are
 

403
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,750
that most of these platforms are
wrapping something like chromium or

00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
televisions run the uh Android stack so
 

433
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,750
televisions run the uh Android stack so
there's uh Android TVs there's also

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
there's uh Android TVs there's also
 

435
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,110
there's uh Android TVs there's also
Google TVs there's also the you know

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,120
Google TVs there's also the you know
 

437
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,350

439
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,310

that I believe is coming out uh might

440
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
that I believe is coming out uh might
 

441
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,590
that I believe is coming out uh might
have already come out or it's coming out

442
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
have already come out or it's coming out
 

443
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,430
have already come out or it's coming out
early next year I forgot um that's built

444
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:38,440
early next year I forgot um that's built
 

445
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,710
early next year I forgot um that's built
on top of Android which is the whole you

446
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
on top of Android which is the whole you
 

447
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,750
on top of Android which is the whole you
know Java stack and all that fun stuff

448
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
know Java stack and all that fun stuff
 

449
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,990
know Java stack and all that fun stuff
and app presumably is a flavor of iOS oh

450
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,000
and app presumably is a flavor of iOS oh
 

451
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,110
and app presumably is a flavor of iOS oh
yes they've got

452
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,120
yes they've got
 

453
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,990
yes they've got
tvos um then we've got the tyen platform

454
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
tvos um then we've got the tyen platform
 

455
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,310
tvos um then we've got the tyen platform
which is uh built in Java the apps I

456
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,320
which is uh built in Java the apps I
 

457
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,790
which is uh built in Java the apps I
think are also web apps um I'm blanking

458
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:57,800
think are also web apps um I'm blanking
 

459
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,870
think are also web apps um I'm blanking
on that right now but but the thing I

460
00:09:59,870 --> 00:09:59,880
on that right now but but the thing I
 

461
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,590
on that right now but but the thing I
think you could take away here is that

462
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
think you could take away here is that
 

463
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,430
think you could take away here is that
every single manufacturer for the most

464
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
every single manufacturer for the most
 

465
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,870
every single manufacturer for the most
part unless we're dealing with the

466
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
part unless we're dealing with the
 

467
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,910
part unless we're dealing with the
android-based televisions and that's a

468
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:06,920
android-based televisions and that's a
 

469
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,470
android-based televisions and that's a
you know decent part of the market um

470
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:09,480
you know decent part of the market um
 

471
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,069
you know decent part of the market um
all are a different fundamental platform

472
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
all are a different fundamental platform
 

473
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,550
all are a different fundamental platform
for working and shipping on and so you

474
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
for working and shipping on and so you
 

475
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,310
for working and shipping on and so you
can imagine that there's Frameworks out

476
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
can imagine that there's Frameworks out
 

477
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,870
can imagine that there's Frameworks out
there that try to normalize you know how

478
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:19,880
there that try to normalize you know how
 

479

uh to to go through here
 

663
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,150
uh to to go through here
um it might make sense actually to go

664
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
um it might make sense actually to go
 

665
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,230
um it might make sense actually to go
bottom up rather than top down if that's

666
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
bottom up rather than top down if that's
 

667
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,110
bottom up rather than top down if that's
okay okay yeah sure we can build up the

stat so let's start at the very uh at
 

671
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,150
stat so let's start at the very uh at
the very bottom which is I have a

672
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,160
the very bottom which is I have a
 

673
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,949

quality video out of the television is
 

687
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,310
quality video out of the television is
not actually the easiest thing yes yeah

688
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
not actually the easiest thing yes yeah
 

689
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,269
not actually the easiest thing yes yeah
yeah

yeah
 

691
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,749
yeah
I okay we're right at the very first

692
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:43,759
I okay we're right at the very first
 

693
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,590
I okay we're right at the very first
hurdle and that sounds horrible what do

694
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
hurdle and that sounds horrible what do
 

695
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,509
hurdle and that sounds horrible what do
you do do you crack them open and try

696
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
you do do you crack them open and try
 

697
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,670
you do do you crack them open and try
and solder in an HDMI

output well I think you probably could

700
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
output well I think you probably could
 

701
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,430
output well I think you probably could
you probably could uh find a way to you

702
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
you probably could uh find a way to you
 

703
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,030
you probably could uh find a way to you
know do a hardware hack and you

704
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,040
know do a hardware hack and you
 

705
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,749
know do a hardware hack and you
know fiddle some wires I'm imagining

706
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:00,759
know fiddle some wires I'm imagining
 

707
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,110
know fiddle some wires I'm imagining
kind of like an action movie where uh

708
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
kind of like an action movie where uh
 

709
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,590
kind of like an action movie where uh
you you're trying to diffuse a bomb uh

Tom Cruz do it in a reasonable time

712
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
Tom Cruz do it in a reasonable time
 

713
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,870
Tom Cruz do it in a reasonable time
frame we tried to hire Tom Cruz to to

714
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:11,880
frame we tried to hire Tom Cruz to to
 

715
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,110

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,120
hack our hardware and it just uh it
 

717
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,910
hack our hardware and it just uh it
wasn't economically viable let's say

718
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
wasn't economically viable let's say
 

719
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,030
wasn't economically viable let's say
that fair enough um you know or maybe

720
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
that fair enough um you know or maybe
 

721
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,590
that fair enough um you know or maybe
you got a little flipper zero here I

722
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:20,600
you got a little flipper zero here I
 

723
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,310
you got a little flipper zero here I
don't know

724
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:23,320
don't know
 

725
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,629
don't know
anyways the solution that we came up

726
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:25,639
anyways the solution that we came up
 

727
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,990
anyways the solution that we came up
with um is well twofold one there's

728
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,000
with um is well twofold one there's
 

729
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,910
with um is well twofold one there's
certain devices where we do have HDMI

730
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:30,920
certain devices where we do have HDMI
 

731
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,829
certain devices where we do have HDMI
out and for that uh an HDMI capture card

732
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
out and for that uh an HDMI capture card
 

733
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,389
out and for that uh an HDMI capture card
you can easily capture the stream in HD

734
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
you can easily capture the stream in HD
 

735
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,829
you can easily capture the stream in HD
you need to have um a particular license

736
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
you need to have um a particular license
 

737
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,829
you need to have um a particular license
not just anyone could be capturing HDMI

738
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
not just anyone could be capturing HDMI
 

739
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,110
not just anyone could be capturing HDMI
out because there's DRM on the devices

740
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,120
out because there's DRM on the devices
 

741
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,910
out because there's DRM on the devices
that prevents you from capturing it in

742
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
that prevents you from capturing it in
 

743
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,990
that prevents you from capturing it in
high quality so you need to be you have

744
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,000
high quality so you need to be you have
 

745
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,189
high quality so you need to be you have
to have a license uh to be able to do

746
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
to have a license uh to be able to do
 

747
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,030
to have a license uh to be able to do
this um and so for devices like set toop

748
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,040
this um and so for devices like set toop
 

749
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,710
this um and so for devices like set toop
boxes you know I'm talking about the

750
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:55,720
boxes you know I'm talking about the
 

751
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,949
boxes you know I'm talking about the
fire TVs Apple sticks of the world I I

752
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:57,959
fire TVs Apple sticks of the world I I
 

753
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,389
fire TVs Apple sticks of the world I I
feel like I'm repeating myself a lot

754
00:15:59,389 --> 00:15:59,399
feel like I'm repeating myself a lot
 

755
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,670

we're going to be hearing about set TP

756
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:00,680
we're going to be hearing about set TP
 

757
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,990
we're going to be hearing about set TP
boxes for the next

758
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,000
boxes for the next
 

759
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,790
boxes for the next
hour uh HDMI capture cards are the way

760
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
hour uh HDMI capture cards are the way
 

761
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,829
hour uh HDMI capture cards are the way
that we get the video out okay but for

762
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:08,839
that we get the video out okay but for
 

763
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,829
that we get the video out okay but for
televisions it's a little bit of a a

764
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:10,839
televisions it's a little bit of a a
 

765
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,710
televisions it's a little bit of a a
bigger challenge because televisions we

766
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:13,720
bigger challenge because televisions we
 

767
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,189
bigger challenge because televisions we
don't have that luxury and so for that

768
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:16,199
don't have that luxury and so for that
 

769
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,629
don't have that luxury and so for that
we use

770
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:17,639
we use
 

771
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,150
we use
cameras

772
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,160
cameras
 

773
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,670
cameras
now this imposes its own in and of

you get the um how do you get the screen

778
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
you get the um how do you get the screen
 

779
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,710
you get the um how do you get the screen
you know which is a you know nice uh you

780
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
you know which is a you know nice uh you
 

781
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,150
you know which is a you know nice uh you
know 1600 by 1280 rectangle um how do

782
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
know 1600 by 1280 rectangle um how do
 

783
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,629
know 1600 by 1280 rectangle um how do
you get that and flatten it because you

784
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
you get that and flatten it because you
 

785
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,870
you get that and flatten it because you
know a camera's lens is always going to

786
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
know a camera's lens is always going to
 

787
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,749
know a camera's lens is always going to
be slightly curved even for the you know

788
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:40,759
be slightly curved even for the you know
 

789
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,030
be slightly curved even for the you know
the flattest you know camera so you're

the flattest you know camera so you're
 

791
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,189
the flattest you know camera so you're
going to have you're going to have

going to have you're going to have
radial Distortion around the camera

794
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:45,959
radial Distortion around the camera
 

795
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,550
radial Distortion around the camera
right yeah um you're also going to have

796
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
right yeah um you're also going to have
 

797
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,749
right yeah um you're also going to have
all that really white light from the TV

798
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:50,759
all that really white light from the TV
 

799
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,230
all that really white light from the TV
saturating all of the color um and

800
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,240
saturating all of the color um and
 

801
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,189
saturating all of the color um and
distorting the image and so if you

802
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
distorting the image and so if you
 

803
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,150
distorting the image and so if you
naively did what um my co-founders did

804
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
naively did what um my co-founders did
 

805
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,470
naively did what um my co-founders did
you know before form TV Labs you're

806
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
you know before form TV Labs you're
 

807
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,230
you know before form TV Labs you're
pointing a TV a webcam at a TV and

808
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,240
pointing a TV a webcam at a TV and
 

809
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,390
pointing a TV a webcam at a TV and
you've got this horrible you know very

810
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:05,400
you've got this horrible you know very
 

811
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,750
you've got this horrible you know very
saturated image that doesn't look very

812
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
saturated image that doesn't look very
 

813
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,669
saturated image that doesn't look very
nice it's not quite a rectangle around

814
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:10,679
nice it's not quite a rectangle around
 

815
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,390
nice it's not quite a rectangle around
the TV but kind of this weird distorted

816
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
the TV but kind of this weird distorted
 

817
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,669
the TV but kind of this weird distorted
rectangle um and so what we did is we

818
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
rectangle um and so what we did is we
 

819
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,510
rectangle um and so what we did is we
found you know cameras that were were

820
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
found you know cameras that were were
 

821
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,710
found you know cameras that were were
going to be really good for the type of

822
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:21,720
going to be really good for the type of
 

823
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,710
going to be really good for the type of
of light and image that we're trying to

824
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:23,720
of light and image that we're trying to
 

825
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,470
of light and image that we're trying to
capture and our goal always was you

826
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
capture and our goal always was you
 

827
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,510
capture and our goal always was you
should be able to stream a 4K movie

828
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
should be able to stream a 4K movie
 

829
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,669
should be able to stream a 4K movie
and for it to show up in your browser as

830
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
and for it to show up in your browser as
 

831
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,029
and for it to show up in your browser as
if it was um you didn't know the

832
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:35,039
if it was um you didn't know the
 

833
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,549
if it was um you didn't know the
difference it was just ship shipping

834
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
difference it was just ship shipping
 

835
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,350
difference it was just ship shipping
your television screen right into your

836
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,360
your television screen right into your
 

837
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,110
your television screen right into your
browser um so we're taking cameras we're

838
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
browser um so we're taking cameras we're
 

839
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,870
browser um so we're taking cameras we're
pointing them at televisions we're then

840
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:43,880
pointing them at televisions we're then
 

841
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,470
pointing them at televisions we're then
uh taking that video stream and uh we

842
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:47,480
uh taking that video stream and uh we
 

843
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,990
uh taking that video stream and uh we
actually have four cameras on our boxes

844
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,000
actually have four cameras on our boxes
 

845
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,310
actually have four cameras on our boxes
so we're stitching them together we're

846
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,320
so we're stitching them together we're
 

847
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,190
so we're stitching them together we're
applying different undistortion

848
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
applying different undistortion
 

849
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,390
applying different undistortion
techniques to uh flatten out the image

850
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
techniques to uh flatten out the image
 

851
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,190
techniques to uh flatten out the image
Stitch it together into that rectangle

852
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:58,200
Stitch it together into that rectangle
 

853
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,669
Stitch it together into that rectangle
why for cameras is this a resolution

854
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:00,679
why for cameras is this a resolution
 

855
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,029
why for cameras is this a resolution
issue it's not a resolution issue we

856
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:03,039
issue it's not a resolution issue we
 

857
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,630
issue it's not a resolution issue we
could do it with one um and I think this

858
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:05,640
could do it with one um and I think this
 

859
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,710
could do it with one um and I think this
is an early optimization that we made

860
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:07,720
is an early optimization that we made
 

861
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,630
is an early optimization that we made
that that maybe we we would change now

862
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:09,640
that that maybe we we would change now
 

863
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,029
that that maybe we we would change now
but uh our goal was to always have a box

864
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:14,039
but uh our goal was to always have a box
 

865
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,390
but uh our goal was to always have a box
a very tiny box that we could stack many

866
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
a very tiny box that we could stack many
 

867
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,029
a very tiny box that we could stack many
many many of them next to each other and

868
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:18,039
many many of them next to each other and
 

869
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,750
many many of them next to each other and
on top of each other so that we can have

870
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
on top of each other so that we can have
 

871
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,430
on top of each other so that we can have
a warehouse full of hundreds or

872
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,440
a warehouse full of hundreds or
 

873
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,669
a warehouse full of hundreds or
thousands of televisions okay and in

874
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:24,679
thousands of televisions okay and in
 

875
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,350
thousands of televisions okay and in
order to do that you know there's a

876
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:26,360
order to do that you know there's a
 

877
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,310
order to do that you know there's a
certain point where uh space becomes you

878
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,320
certain point where uh space becomes you
 

879
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,510
certain point where uh space becomes you
know a limiting factor for how many you

880
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
know a limiting factor for how many you
 

881
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,190
know a limiting factor for how many you
can have in your Warehouse unless you

882
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
can have in your Warehouse unless you
 

883
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,390
can have in your Warehouse unless you
have a lot of vertical

884
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:35,400
have a lot of vertical
 

885
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,669
have a lot of vertical
space that's his challengeing of itself

886
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
space that's his challengeing of itself
 

887
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,510
space that's his challengeing of itself
so what we wanted was to get the cameras

888
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
so what we wanted was to get the cameras
 

889
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,870
so what we wanted was to get the cameras
nice and close to the television so the

890
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:41,880
nice and close to the television so the
 

891
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,390
nice and close to the television so the
depth of our boxes could be very narrow

892
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
depth of our boxes could be very narrow
 

893
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,230
depth of our boxes could be very narrow
oh right yeah so you've got for you've

894
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,240
oh right yeah so you've got for you've
 

895
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,669
oh right yeah so you've got for you've
got to have a camera a certain distance

896
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:48,679
got to have a camera a certain distance
 

897
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,830
got to have a camera a certain distance
away from the television to be able to

898
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
away from the television to be able to
 

899
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,630
away from the television to be able to
see the whole thing like a parent

900
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:51,640
see the whole thing like a parent
 

901
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,669
see the whole thing like a parent
shouting at their child to sit back from

902
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
shouting at their child to sit back from
 

903
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,149
shouting at their child to sit back from
the TV that's right so you've got four

904
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:57,159
the TV that's right so you've got four
 

905
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,430
the TV that's right so you've got four
up close yeah okay so now I see why

906
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
up close yeah okay so now I see why
 

907
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,190
up close yeah okay so now I see why
you've got a stitching four video

908
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,200
you've got a stitching four video
 

909
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,230
you've got a stitching four video
streams back together problem right and

910
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,240
streams back together problem right and
 

911
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,390
streams back together problem right and
then we need to make all these different

912
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,400
then we need to make all these different
 

913
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,390
then we need to make all these different
uh you know you have four video streams

914
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,400
uh you know you have four video streams
 

915
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,669
uh you know you have four video streams
but they're overlapping uh they're going

916
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
but they're overlapping uh they're going
 

917
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,070
but they're overlapping uh they're going
beyond the you know the edges of the

918
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
beyond the you know the edges of the
 

919
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,390
beyond the you know the edges of the
television stream and so we apply

920
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:17,400
television stream and so we apply
 

921
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,549
television stream and so we apply
different computer vision techniques to

922
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:19,559
different computer vision techniques to
 

923
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,950
different computer vision techniques to
get that back to that nice rectangle we

924
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:21,960
get that back to that nice rectangle we
 

925
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,310
get that back to that nice rectangle we
apply uh an undistortion to flatten it

926
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,320
apply uh an undistortion to flatten it
 

927
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,310
apply uh an undistortion to flatten it
uh uh and and color correct it and then

928
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
uh uh and and color correct it and then
 

929
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,590
uh uh and and color correct it and then
what what ends up happening is that we

930
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:30,600
what what ends up happening is that we
 

931
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,190
what what ends up happening is that we
have this video stream that we can then

932
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,200
have this video stream that we can then
 

933
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,909
have this video stream that we can then
strip to your browser over web RTC

934
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:34,919
strip to your browser over web RTC
 

935
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,029
strip to your browser over web RTC
that's nice and flat and you couldn't

936
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
that's nice and flat and you couldn't
 

937
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,350
that's nice and flat and you couldn't
tell the difference that there were four

938
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,360
tell the difference that there were four
 

939
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,190
tell the difference that there were four
cameras there's no seam it it looks

940
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
cameras there's no seam it it looks
 

941
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,310
cameras there's no seam it it looks
perfect do you have the luxury of that

942
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:43,320
perfect do you have the luxury of that
 

943
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,630
perfect do you have the luxury of that
being repeatable like can you set those

944
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640
being repeatable like can you set those
 

945
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,990
being repeatable like can you set those
settings once for the four cameras and

946
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
settings once for the four cameras and
 

947
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,789
settings once for the four cameras and
expect it to work with every television

948
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:51,799
expect it to work with every television
 

949
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,390
expect it to work with every television
that you've got a box for thereafter or

950
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
that you've got a box for thereafter or
 

951
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,230
that you've got a box for thereafter or
do you have to hand tweak each each

952
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240
do you have to hand tweak each each
 

953
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,310
do you have to hand tweak each each
quartet

954
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,320
quartet
 

955
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,909
quartet
so there is some amount of hand tweaking

956
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
so there is some amount of hand tweaking
 

957
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,870
so there is some amount of hand tweaking
that um we did early on uh now we

958
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
that um we did early on uh now we
 

959
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,270
that um we did early on uh now we
actually have a pretty nice process for

960
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,280
actually have a pretty nice process for
 

961
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,710
actually have a pretty nice process for
um each one of our cameras um goes

962
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
um each one of our cameras um goes
 

963
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,909
um each one of our cameras um goes
through a um a tuning process before it

964
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:14,919
through a um a tuning process before it
 

965
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,190
through a um a tuning process before it
even goes into a box and then it's all

966
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
even goes into a box and then it's all
 

967
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,789
even goes into a box and then it's all
calibrated nicely and then when it's put

968
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
calibrated nicely and then when it's put
 

969
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,950
calibrated nicely and then when it's put
into the box is great but even with a

970
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
into the box is great but even with a
 

971
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,430
into the box is great but even with a
calibrated camera it's not going to be

972
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:22,440
calibrated camera it's not going to be
 

973
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,310
calibrated camera it's not going to be
pointed you know you know perfectly uh

974
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,320
pointed you know you know perfectly uh
 

975
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,230
pointed you know you know perfectly uh
you know head on to the television

976
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,240
you know head on to the television
 

977
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,710
you know head on to the television
there's always going to be a slight

978
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
there's always going to be a slight
 

979
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,029
there's always going to be a slight
angle and the TV might not be on the

980
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
angle and the TV might not be on the
 

981
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,510
angle and the TV might not be on the
mount perfectly U so we have this

982
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
mount perfectly U so we have this
 

983
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,270
mount perfectly U so we have this
calibration process where we cook a

984
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,280
calibration process where we cook a
 

985
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,710
calibration process where we cook a
button in our platform uh it shows a

986
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
button in our platform uh it shows a
 

987
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,990
button in our platform uh it shows a
special image that it uses to you know

988
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
special image that it uses to you know
 

989
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,830
special image that it uses to you know
calculate what's called homography with

990
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
calculate what's called homography with
 

991
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,510
calculate what's called homography with
a television um find that that perfect

992
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
a television um find that that perfect
 

993
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,990
a television um find that that perfect
calibration and then it uses that math

994
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
calibration and then it uses that math
 

995
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,029
calibration and then it uses that math
um the math that it deres from the

996
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:52,039
um the math that it deres from the
 

997
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,909
um the math that it deres from the
calibration image to find that perfect

998
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:54,919
calibration image to find that perfect
 

999
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,470
calibration image to find that perfect
uh point of reference yeah yeah yeah so

1000
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:57,480
uh point of reference yeah yeah yeah so
 

1001
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,230
uh point of reference yeah yeah yeah so
it's basically automa the test card of

1002
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
it's basically automa the test card of
 

1003
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,390
it's basically automa the test card of
old that's right that's right okay I'm

1004
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
old that's right that's right okay I'm
 

1005
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,669
old that's right that's right okay I'm
already getting a sense that we're going

1006
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
already getting a sense that we're going
 

1007
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,110
already getting a sense that we're going
to be solving so many micro problems

1008
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,120
to be solving so many micro problems
 

1009
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,789
to be solving so many micro problems
along the journey to getting this whole

1010
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:11,799
along the journey to getting this whole
 

1011
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,230
along the journey to getting this whole
thing working there a lot of mic

1012
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
thing working there a lot of mic
 

1013
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,789
thing working there a lot of mic
problems yeah that that is basically my

1014
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
problems yeah that that is basically my
 

1015
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,070
problems yeah that that is basically my
life yes so you asked you asked a

1016
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,080
life yes so you asked you asked a
 

1017
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,590
life yes so you asked you asked a
question that you know we're on a

1018
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:20,600
question that you know we're on a
 

1019
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,549
question that you know we're on a
journey to get there which is how do you

1020
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
journey to get there which is how do you
 

1021
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,269
journey to get there which is how do you
automate testing televisions but you

1022
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:25,279
automate testing televisions but you
 

1023
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,990
automate testing televisions but you
know it's like building an apple pie

1024
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,000
know it's like building an apple pie
 

1025
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,269
know it's like building an apple pie
from scratch you know we first must

1026
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:28,279
from scratch you know we first must
 

1027
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,549
from scratch you know we first must
invent the universe we first must invent

1028
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
invent the universe we first must invent
 

1029
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,870
invent the universe we first must invent
every single possible way to automate

1030
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
every single possible way to automate
 

1031
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,430
every single possible way to automate
interacting with the television

1032
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:34,440
interacting with the television
 

1033
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,070
interacting with the television
otherwise it will consistently break in

1034
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,080
otherwise it will consistently break in
 

1035
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,830
otherwise it will consistently break in
new and spectacular ways every day yeah

1036
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:40,840
new and spectacular ways every day yeah
 

1037
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,870
new and spectacular ways every day yeah
I guess that's a competitive Advantage

1038
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
I guess that's a competitive Advantage
 

1039
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,510
I guess that's a competitive Advantage
as well right so in the long run that's

1040
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
as well right so in the long run that's
 

1041
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,789
as well right so in the long run that's
right but yeah keep your life

1042
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
right but yeah keep your life
 

1043
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,549
right but yeah keep your life
interesting okay so you've reached the

1044
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
interesting okay so you've reached the
 

1045
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,710
interesting okay so you've reached the
point where you can stream web

1046
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
point where you can stream web
 

1047
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,750
point where you can stream web
RTC out of a televis

1048
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
RTC out of a televis
 

1049
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,909
RTC out of a televis
effectively but Chris wouldn't you

1050
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
effectively but Chris wouldn't you
 

1051
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,590
effectively but Chris wouldn't you
wouldn't you agree that it's pretty

1052
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
wouldn't you agree that it's pretty
 

1053
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,269
wouldn't you agree that it's pretty
boring to stream at television that's

1054
00:21:59,269 --> 00:21:59,279
boring to stream at television that's
 

1055
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,830
boring to stream at television that's
not on you'd probably want to be able to

1056
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:00,840
not on you'd probably want to be able to
 

1057
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,269
not on you'd probably want to be able to
turn it on too okay yeah yeah yeah so

1058
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:04,279
turn it on too okay yeah yeah yeah so
 

1059
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,029
turn it on too okay yeah yeah yeah so
okay we have a problem of input now

1060
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:06,039
okay we have a problem of input now
 

1061
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,549
okay we have a problem of input now
which is okay we've got a we've got

1062
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
which is okay we've got a we've got
 

1063
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,190
which is okay we've got a we've got
these cameras pointing at a television

1064
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,200
these cameras pointing at a television
 

1065
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,350
these cameras pointing at a television
in a a dark box um you know in order to

1066
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:14,360
in a a dark box um you know in order to
 

1067
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,310
in a a dark box um you know in order to
do something useful with it we're not

1068
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
do something useful with it we're not
 

1069
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,230
do something useful with it we're not
even getting to the problem of uploading

1070
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
even getting to the problem of uploading
 

1071
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,789
even getting to the problem of uploading
you know your your build to the

1072
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:19,799
you know your your build to the
 

1073
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,110
you know your your build to the
television uh and we'll get to there

1074
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,120
television uh and we'll get to there
 

1075
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,390
television uh and we'll get to there
later uh how do I turn the thing on and

1076
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:25,400
later uh how do I turn the thing on and
 

1077
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,310
later uh how do I turn the thing on and
how do I navigate to a channel how do I

1078
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:27,320
how do I navigate to a channel how do I
 

1079
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,870
how do I navigate to a channel how do I
change the settings how do I do all

1080
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
change the settings how do I do all
 

1081
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,750
change the settings how do I do all
these things

1082
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:30,760
these things
 

1083
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,630
these things
um so we have um an IR diode in there

1084
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:35,640
um so we have um an IR diode in there
 

1085
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,350
um so we have um an IR diode in there
we've got something called CC which uh

1086
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,360
we've got something called CC which uh
 

1087
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,510
we've got something called CC which uh
allows you to interact over HTMI uh for

1088
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
allows you to interact over HTMI uh for
 

1089
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,269
allows you to interact over HTMI uh for
you know each individual platform we've

1090
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:43,279
you know each individual platform we've
 

1091
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,430
you know each individual platform we've
got web-based and grpc based protocols

1092
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:46,440
got web-based and grpc based protocols
 

1093
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,950
got web-based and grpc based protocols
for uh sending messages back and forth

1094
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
for uh sending messages back and forth
 

1095
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,310
for uh sending messages back and forth
to the television um you got all of

1096
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:51,320
to the television um you got all of
 

1097
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,350
to the television um you got all of
these different ways uh to interact with

1098
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
these different ways uh to interact with
 

1099
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,230
these different ways uh to interact with
the television that we have to solve

1100
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,240
the television that we have to solve
 

1101
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,110
the television that we have to solve
through hardware and we have to solve

1102
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
through hardware and we have to solve
 

1103
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,029
through hardware and we have to solve
through uh different types of apis right

1104
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:00,039
through uh different types of apis right
 

1105
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,350
through uh different types of apis right
on the box so I'm imagining the you say

1106
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:04,360
on the box so I'm imagining the you say
 

1107
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,269
on the box so I'm imagining the you say
the two main control two ways you can s

1108
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:07,279
the two main control two ways you can s
 

1109
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,870
the two main control two ways you can s
controls of the television are CC you

1110
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:09,880
controls of the television are CC you
 

1111
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,230
controls of the television are CC you
called it that's the one over HDMI right

1112
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
called it that's the one over HDMI right
 

1113
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,870
called it that's the one over HDMI right
that's right that I would guess is

1114
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:13,880
that's right that I would guess is
 

1115
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,510
that's right that I would guess is
fairly

1116
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
fairly

pretty useful for intercepting IR

1136
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
pretty useful for intercepting IR

00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
they work now some of them are published
 

1141
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,230
they work now some of them are published
right so every single television uh is

1142
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
right so every single television uh is
 

1143
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,950
right so every single television uh is
going to have slightly different IR

1144
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:47,960
going to have slightly different IR
 

1145
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,029
going to have slightly different IR
protocols for how you might send

1146
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:50,039
protocols for how you might send
 

1147
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,310
protocols for how you might send
commands uh so there's the basic stuff

1148
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
commands uh so there's the basic stuff
 

1149
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,029
commands uh so there's the basic stuff
like turn on Channel Down Channel up

1150
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
like turn on Channel Down Channel up
 

1151
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,350
like turn on Channel Down Channel up
there's more complicated things like

1152
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
there's more complicated things like
 

1153
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,549
there's more complicated things like
I've held down the the volume down

1154
00:23:59,549 --> 00:23:59,559
I've held down the the volume down
 

1155
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:02,990
I've held down the the volume down
button uh that's now a long press uh

1156
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,000

1157
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,269
button uh that's now a long press uh
each television manufacturer might have

1158
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:05,279
each television manufacturer might have
 

1159
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,230
each television manufacturer might have
slightly different ways of implementing

1160
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,240
slightly different ways of implementing
 

1161
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,870
slightly different ways of implementing
that IR yeah that didn't surprise me so

1162
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
that IR yeah that didn't surprise me so
 

1163
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,430
that IR yeah that didn't surprise me so
we have a a PCB a printed circuit board

1164
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:14,440
we have a a PCB a printed circuit board
 

1165
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,750
we have a a PCB a printed circuit board
which has an IR actually multiple IR

1166
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:16,760
which has an IR actually multiple IR
 

1167
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,549
which has an IR actually multiple IR
diodes connected to it and we'll send

1168
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
diodes connected to it and we'll send
 

1169
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,789
diodes connected to it and we'll send
those uh IR signals over the IR diode

1170
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:23,799
those uh IR signals over the IR diode
 

1171
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:24,990
those uh IR signals over the IR diode
and that will communicate with the

1172
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,000
and that will communicate with the
 

1173
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,070
and that will communicate with the
television just how your very basic

1174
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,080
television just how your very basic
 

1175
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,630
television just how your very basic
remote would um you said that CC you

1176
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
remote would um you said that CC you
 

1177
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,590
remote would um you said that CC you
know that must be a very uh ubiquitous

1178
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
know that must be a very uh ubiquitous
 

1179
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,029
know that must be a very uh ubiquitous
standard and and you can imagine cc is

1180
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:36,039
standard and and you can imagine cc is
 

1181
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,990
standard and and you can imagine cc is
like uh again set up boxes we're going

1182
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,000
like uh again set up boxes we're going
 

1183
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,549
like uh again set up boxes we're going
to keep saying it Fire TV you turn on

1184
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:41,559
to keep saying it Fire TV you turn on
 

1185

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,149
the Fire TV that turns on your
television the way that that works is

1188
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:45,159
television the way that that works is
 

1189
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:48,909
television the way that that works is
that the Fire TV is sending a cc standby

1190
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:48,919
that the Fire TV is sending a cc standby

command to the television saying hey
 

1193
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,549
command to the television saying hey
turn on um the unfortunate thing is that

1194
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:55,559
turn on um the unfortunate thing is that
 

1195
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,510
turn on um the unfortunate thing is that
while they are standard quote unquote uh

1196
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:58,520
while they are standard quote unquote uh
 

1197
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,310
while they are standard quote unquote uh
all behave uh slightly differently with

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,320
all behave uh slightly differently with
 

1199
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,470
all behave uh slightly differently with
each manufacturer and not everything

1200
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,480
each manufacturer and not everything
 

1201
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,350
each manufacturer and not everything
always works as expected so we have many

1202
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,360
always works as expected so we have many
 

1203
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,909
always works as expected so we have many
different things on our platform that's

1204
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
different things on our platform that's
 

1205
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,070
different things on our platform that's
really tuned for the particular platform

1206
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
really tuned for the particular platform
 

1207
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,590
really tuned for the particular platform
to work most

1208
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,600
to work most
 

1209
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,909
to work most
reliably um and this actually goes with

1210
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:13,919
reliably um and this actually goes with
 

1211
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,350
reliably um and this actually goes with
communication in general we have to make

1212
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:16,360
communication in general we have to make
 

1213
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,029
communication in general we have to make
sure

1214
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:18,039
sure
 

1215
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:21,789
sure
that on any one platform not only can we

1216
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:21,799
that on any one platform not only can we
 

1217
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,830
that on any one platform not only can we
provide all the capabilities you know

1218
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
provide all the capabilities you know
 

1219
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,350
provide all the capabilities you know
ircc whatever um but also be able to

1220
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
ircc whatever um but also be able to
 

1221
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,630
ircc whatever um but also be able to
choose you know in certain situations

1222
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:29,640
choose you know in certain situations
 

1223
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,230
choose you know in certain situations
you might want to test IR but you also

1224
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,240
you might want to test IR but you also
 

1225
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,549
you might want to test IR but you also
might want to test the Roku specific API

1226
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
might want to test the Roku specific API
 

1227
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,870
might want to test the Roku specific API
for example so we have to provide all of

1228
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
for example so we have to provide all of
 

1229
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,990
for example so we have to provide all of
them um and we'll usually choose the

1230
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,000
them um and we'll usually choose the
 

1231
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,029
them um and we'll usually choose the
standard one for when you're uh trying

1232
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
standard one for when you're uh trying
 

1233
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,110
standard one for when you're uh trying
to interact through our web platform uh

1234
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
to interact through our web platform uh
 

1235
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,950
to interact through our web platform uh
the most reliable for that right I I I I

1236
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
the most reliable for that right I I I I
 

1237
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,029
the most reliable for that right I I I I
feel like this is going to be a

1238
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:48,039
feel like this is going to be a
 

1239
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,870
feel like this is going to be a
disappointing answer but I have to ask

1240
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:49,880
disappointing answer but I have to ask
 

1241
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,990
disappointing answer but I have to ask
the question do we at any point do we

1242
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
the question do we at any point do we
 

1243
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,149
the question do we at any point do we
get a robot arm pushing the buttons on

1244
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
get a robot arm pushing the buttons on
 

1245
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:54,870
get a robot arm pushing the buttons on
the

1246
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
the
 

1247
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,710
the
television so our first prototype was a

1248
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:57,720
television so our first prototype was a
 

1249
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,710
television so our first prototype was a
severed hand that would poke around at

1250
00:25:59,710 --> 00:25:59,720
severed hand that would poke around at
 

1251
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,190
severed hand that would poke around at
the television uh sing from the Adam

1252
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,200
the television uh sing from the Adam
 

1253
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,510
the television uh sing from the Adam
family that's right again you know just

1254
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
family that's right again you know just
 

1255
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,950
family that's right again you know just
like Tom Cruz we didn't think that was

1256
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960
like Tom Cruz we didn't think that was
 

1257
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,230
like Tom Cruz we didn't think that was
going to scale so we had to decommission

1258
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,240
going to scale so we had to decommission
 

1259
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,950
going to scale so we had to decommission
that that particular

1260
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
that that particular
 

1261
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,789
that that particular
path damn I was I was I was hoping that

1262
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:13,799
path damn I was I was I was hoping that
 

1263
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,389
path damn I was I was I was hoping that
in just a few cases you'd have something

1264
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:16,399
in just a few cases you'd have something
 

1265
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:18,389
in just a few cases you'd have something
like okay

1266
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:18,399
like okay
 

1267
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:21,510
like okay
so there's that makes me think of one

1268
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
so there's that makes me think of one
 

1269
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,909
so there's that makes me think of one
other big input that you haven't

1270
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:22,919
other big input that you haven't
 

1271
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,110
other big input that you haven't
mentioned to the television which is

1272
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,120
mentioned to the television which is
 

1273
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,789
mentioned to the television which is
power do you have some kind of power

1274
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:26,799
power do you have some kind of power
 

1275
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,710
power do you have some kind of power
control so you can hard read boot the

1276
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
control so you can hard read boot the
 

1277
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,389
control so you can hard read boot the
television when it

1278
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:30,399
television when it
 

1279
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:33,909
television when it
crashes uh we do not we have I think

1280
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
crashes uh we do not we have I think
 

1281
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,669
crashes uh we do not we have I think
five different uh Power controls for

1282
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:36,679
five different uh Power controls for
 

1283
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:42,470
five different uh Power controls for
five okay me that so okay um why is one

1284
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
five okay me that so okay um why is one
 

1285
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,350
five okay me that so okay um why is one
good

1286
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,360
good
 

1287
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,870
good
enough man

1288
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
enough man
 

1289
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,230
enough man
so okay I come from a a background of

1290
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
so okay I come from a a background of
 

1291
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,510
so okay I come from a a background of
LLG and elixir and the beam and the

1292
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:52,520
LLG and elixir and the beam and the
 

1293
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,029
LLG and elixir and the beam and the
philosophy is let it crash um the

1294
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:56,039
philosophy is let it crash um the
 

1295
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,269
philosophy is let it crash um the
problem is that with when you're

1296
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
problem is that with when you're
 

1297
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,909
problem is that with when you're
managing Hardware where uh things don't

1298
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
managing Hardware where uh things don't
 

1299
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,909
managing Hardware where uh things don't
always crash in a clean way they clean

1300
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:02,919
always crash in a clean way they clean
 

1301
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,190
always crash in a clean way they clean
they they crash in uh dirty and weird

1302
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
they they crash in uh dirty and weird
 

1303
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,470
they they crash in uh dirty and weird
ways and uh they'll manifest in just

1304
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
ways and uh they'll manifest in just
 

1305
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,549
ways and uh they'll manifest in just
things will crash Loop and generate a

1306
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
things will crash Loop and generate a
 

1307
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,110
things will crash Loop and generate a
terabyte and a half of logs or um uh

1308
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
terabyte and a half of logs or um uh
 

1309
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,310
terabyte and a half of logs or um uh
your cameras will just you know die and

1310
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,320
your cameras will just you know die and
 

1311
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,750
your cameras will just you know die and
and stop working and so there's all

1312
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
and stop working and so there's all
 

1313
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,310
and stop working and so there's all
these different little mechanisms that

1314
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:23,320
these different little mechanisms that
 

1315
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,110
these different little mechanisms that
we have that are monitoring the state of

1316
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
we have that are monitoring the state of
 

1317
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,909
we have that are monitoring the state of
our system and trying to uh detect the

1318
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:28,919
our system and trying to uh detect the
 

1319
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,909
our system and trying to uh detect the
uh degradation in quality um and

1320
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
uh degradation in quality um and
 

1321
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,669
uh degradation in quality um and
depending on what fails we might want to

1322
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:34,679
depending on what fails we might want to
 

1323
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,990
depending on what fails we might want to
power cycle the device at a different

1324
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,000
power cycle the device at a different
 

1325
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,389
power cycle the device at a different
level um so the first level is the

1326
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:40,399
level um so the first level is the
 

1327
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,470
level um so the first level is the
device itself so you can through the

1328
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
device itself so you can through the
 

1329
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,110
device itself so you can through the
remote you know turn it on and turn it

1330
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
remote you know turn it on and turn it
 

1331
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,789
remote you know turn it on and turn it
off yeah uh the thing that you might

1332
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:47,799
off yeah uh the thing that you might
 

1333
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,149
off yeah uh the thing that you might
know owning a television is that turning

1334
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:50,159
know owning a television is that turning
 

1335
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,669
know owning a television is that turning
it on and off might not actually turn it

1336
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
it on and off might not actually turn it
 

1337
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,230
it on and off might not actually turn it
off it might turn the screen off but it

1338
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,240
off it might turn the screen off but it
 

1339
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,750
off it might turn the screen off but it
might just go into a standby and then

1340
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:54,760
might just go into a standby and then
 

1341
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,870
might just go into a standby and then
it's just ready to go back on and so

1342
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
it's just ready to go back on and so
 

1343
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,909
it's just ready to go back on and so
that standby is not you know useful

1344
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
that standby is not you know useful
 

1345
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,269
that standby is not you know useful
enough when you have like some weird

1346
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:01,279
enough when you have like some weird
 

1347
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,310
enough when you have like some weird
state that you're in and you want to

1348
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,320
state that you're in and you want to
 

1349
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,310
state that you're in and you want to
power

1350
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,320
power
 

1351
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,549
power
cycle

1352
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:05,559
cycle
 

1353
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,389
cycle
so the next level on the hardware

1354
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:09,399
so the next level on the hardware
 

1355
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:13,110
so the next level on the hardware
is power cycle the actual uh Power going

1356
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
is power cycle the actual uh Power going
 

1357
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,110
is power cycle the actual uh Power going
directly to the television itself and

1358
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
directly to the television itself and
 

1359
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,590
directly to the television itself and
for that we have uh a power relay in our

1360
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
for that we have uh a power relay in our
 

1361
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,750
for that we have uh a power relay in our
boxes that is able to turn the device on

1362
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
boxes that is able to turn the device on
 

1363
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,870
boxes that is able to turn the device on
and off um kind of sibling to that is

1364
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880
and off um kind of sibling to that is
 

1365
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,909
and off um kind of sibling to that is
our software that is running next to

1366
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:24,919
our software that is running next to
 

1367
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,590
our software that is running next to
these devices um sometimes that goes WR

1368
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:28,600
these devices um sometimes that goes WR
 

1369
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,590
these devices um sometimes that goes WR
and so we have Docker containers running

1370
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
and so we have Docker containers running
 

1371
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,389
and so we have Docker containers running
uh we might recycle those Docker

1372
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:33,399
uh we might recycle those Docker
 

1373
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,549
uh we might recycle those Docker
containers so that's another way of

1374
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
containers so that's another way of
 

1375
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,070
containers so that's another way of
turning it off and on um we might the

1376
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
turning it off and on um we might the
 

1377
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,590
turning it off and on um we might the
compute that's on the device itself we

1378
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
compute that's on the device itself we
 

1379
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,430
compute that's on the device itself we
might need to turn that on and off and

1380
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,440
might need to turn that on and off and
 

1381
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,070
might need to turn that on and off and
then if all else fails we have a relay

1382
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
then if all else fails we have a relay
 

1383
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,549
then if all else fails we have a relay
going to the actual wall and we'll turn

1384
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
going to the actual wall and we'll turn
 

1385
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,230
going to the actual wall and we'll turn
off the entire power going to the entire

1386
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:49,240
off the entire power going to the entire
 

1387
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,470
off the entire power going to the entire
box off wait a few seconds and back on

1388
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:53,480
box off wait a few seconds and back on
 

1389
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,669
box off wait a few seconds and back on
again so you've mentioned there we

1390
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:55,679
again so you've mentioned there we
 

1391
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,230
again so you've mentioned there we
haven't really looked at it there is is

1392
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,240
haven't really looked at it there is is
 

1393
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,070
haven't really looked at it there is is
some kind of computer inside this box

1394
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,080
some kind of computer inside this box
 

1395
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,909
some kind of computer inside this box
that so the cameras aren't trailing a

1396
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:03,919
that so the cameras aren't trailing a
 

1397
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,269
that so the cameras aren't trailing a
wire out to some Central server the

1398
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:06,279
wire out to some Central server the
 

1399
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,269
wire out to some Central server the
camera there's local processing inside

1400
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:08,279
camera there's local processing inside
 

1401
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,389
camera there's local processing inside
the container that's right so every sing

1402
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:11,399
the container that's right so every sing
 

1403
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:14,549
the container that's right so every sing
so every single one of our devices has

1404
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559
so every single one of our devices has
 

1405
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,470
so every single one of our devices has
um basically a beefy uh G GPU uh driven

1406
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
um basically a beefy uh G GPU uh driven
 

1407
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,470
um basically a beefy uh G GPU uh driven
uh computer that's sitting on the device

1408
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,480
uh computer that's sitting on the device
 

1409
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,070
uh computer that's sitting on the device
itself that's running our specialized

1410
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,080
itself that's running our specialized
 

1411
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,350
itself that's running our specialized
software uh and bundling up a bunch of

1412
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,360
software uh and bundling up a bunch of
 

1413
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,830
software uh and bundling up a bunch of
um a vendor specific uh software that

1414
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
um a vendor specific uh software that
 

1415
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,389
um a vendor specific uh software that
allows us to communicate with the

1416
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:33,399
allows us to communicate with the
 

1417
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,669
allows us to communicate with the
television you know they're all

running you know elixir on our um on our
 

1435
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,630
running you know elixir on our um on our
devices but we're doing doing a lot more

1436
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,640
devices but we're doing doing a lot more
 

1437
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,389
devices but we're doing doing a lot more
than just um you know taking frames off

1438
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:01,399
than just um you know taking frames off
 

1439
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,789
than just um you know taking frames off
of cameras and audio and shipping it you

1440
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:03,799
of cameras and audio and shipping it you
 

1441
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,190
of cameras and audio and shipping it you
know we're also doing machine learning

1442
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
know we're also doing machine learning
 

1443
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,950
know we're also doing machine learning
on every frame we're also doing uh

1444
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:07,960
on every frame we're also doing uh
 

1445
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,990
on every frame we're also doing uh
computer vision and audio processing and

1446
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
computer vision and audio processing and
 

1447
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,029
computer vision and audio processing and
uh you know recording the video and

1448
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:14,039
uh you know recording the video and
 

1449
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,549
uh you know recording the video and
shipping it out to the cloud so that you

1450
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:15,559
shipping it out to the cloud so that you
 

1451
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,350
shipping it out to the cloud so that you
can watch you know your sessions after

1452
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:18,360
can watch you know your sessions after
 

1453
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,350
can watch you know your sessions after
uh you know you've interacted with it um

1454
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,360
uh you know you've interacted with it um
 

1455
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,590
uh you know you've interacted with it um
so all of that is happening on this uh

1456
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:22,600
so all of that is happening on this uh
 

1457
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,389
so all of that is happening on this uh
specialized piece of Hardware that's

1458
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:24,399
specialized piece of Hardware that's
 

1459

specialized piece of Hardware that's
connected to our printed circuit boards

1460
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:26,200
connected to our printed circuit boards
 

1461
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,029
connected to our printed circuit boards
that has all these different referrals

1462
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:28,039
that has all these different referrals
 

1463
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:30,190
that has all these different referrals
that we can control through our

1464
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,200
that we can control through our
 

1465
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,310

software
um we also have you know our own power

1468
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:34,760
um we also have you know our own power
 

1469
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,590
um we also have you know our own power
relay we have a display on the device

1470
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:37,600
relay we have a display on the device
 

1471
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,029
relay we have a display on the device
that's driven uh by um you know little

1472
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
that's driven uh by um you know little
 

1473
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,350
that's driven uh by um you know little
C++ program we have that can tell you

1474
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360
C++ program we have that can tell you
 

1475
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,630
C++ program we have that can tell you
the temperature of inside of the box and

1476
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:45,640
the temperature of inside of the box and
 

1477
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,230
the temperature of inside of the box and
can send an alert up to our web platform

1478
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
can send an alert up to our web platform
 

1479
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,630
can send an alert up to our web platform
if it's crossing a certain threshold uh

1480
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
if it's crossing a certain threshold uh
 

1481
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,389
if it's crossing a certain threshold uh
there's all these little little things

1482
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:52,399
there's all these little little things
 

1483
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,549
there's all these little little things
that we need to be monitoring at all

1484
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
that we need to be monitoring at all
 

1485
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,029
that we need to be monitoring at all
points in time to make sure that our

1486
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:56,039
points in time to make sure that our
 

1487
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,710
points in time to make sure that our
boxes are healthy and safe and all that

1488
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720
boxes are healthy and safe and all that
 

1489
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,149
boxes are healthy and safe and all that
fun stuff do you also have I mean this

1490
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:01,159
fun stuff do you also have I mean this
 

1491
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,990
fun stuff do you also have I mean this
is slight aside but do you also have

1492
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,000
is slight aside but do you also have
 

1493
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,110
is slight aside but do you also have
like Cooling and how does that interfere

1494
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,120
like Cooling and how does that interfere
 

1495
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,990
like Cooling and how does that interfere
with capturing the

1496
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
with capturing the
 

1497
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,710
with capturing the
audio that's a very good question uh we

1498
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
audio that's a very good question uh we
 

1499
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,430
audio that's a very good question uh we
do have cooling we have um kind of the

1500
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440
do have cooling we have um kind of the
 

1501
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,190
do have cooling we have um kind of the
ambient cooling of the room we have you

1502
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
ambient cooling of the room we have you
 

1503
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,669
ambient cooling of the room we have you
know air conditioning that's pumping in

1504
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:17,679
know air conditioning that's pumping in
 

1505
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,549
know air conditioning that's pumping in
um but we also have on either side of

1506
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:19,559
um but we also have on either side of
 

1507
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,269
um but we also have on either side of
the Box we've got um two fans that are

1508
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
the Box we've got um two fans that are
 

1509
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,669
the Box we've got um two fans that are
uh blowing air in and out of the box uh

1510
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
uh blowing air in and out of the box uh
 

1511
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,430
uh blowing air in and out of the box uh
to provide circulation so uh not blowing

1512
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:28,440
to provide circulation so uh not blowing
 

1513
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,909
to provide circulation so uh not blowing
air in they're blowing air through the

1514
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:30,919
air in they're blowing air through the
 

1515
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,509
air in they're blowing air through the
box which provides um yeah enough

1516
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:34,519
box which provides um yeah enough
 

1517
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,830
box which provides um yeah enough
cooling to keep the the boxes uh at the

1518
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:36,840
cooling to keep the the boxes uh at the
 

1519
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,830
cooling to keep the the boxes uh at the
right

1520
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
right
 

1521
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,710
right
temperature so and you as about audio

1522
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,720
temperature so and you as about audio
 

1523
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,870
temperature so and you as about audio
yeah you asked about audio so

1524
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
yeah you asked about audio so
 

1525
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,990
yeah you asked about audio so
um audio is not the the the noise of the

1526
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000
um audio is not the the the noise of the
 

1527
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,909
um audio is not the the the noise of the
fans um isn't necessarily a problem

1528
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:50,919
fans um isn't necessarily a problem
 

1529
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:52,470
fans um isn't necessarily a problem
because we don't have a microphone in

1530
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:52,480
because we don't have a microphone in
 

1531
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,549
because we don't have a microphone in
there you know we do have the we don't

1532
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
there you know we do have the we don't
 

1533
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,909
there you know we do have the we don't
have HDMI out but we do have audio out

1534
00:31:56,909 --> 00:31:56,919
have HDMI out but we do have audio out
 

1535
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:59,029
have HDMI out but we do have audio out
um so we are able to always cuz I would

1536
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
um so we are able to always cuz I would
 

1537
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,950
um so we are able to always cuz I would
have thought in for a lot of televisions

1538
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
have thought in for a lot of televisions
 

1539
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,070
have thought in for a lot of televisions
you do and for some you

1540
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,080
you do and for some you
 

1541
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,110
you do and for some you
don't um for every device that we're

1542
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,120
don't um for every device that we're
 

1543
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,149
don't um for every device that we're
working with I I believe we do have the

1544
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:08,159
working with I I believe we do have the
 

1545
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,269
working with I I believe we do have the
audio out that's e okay yeah I guess I

1546
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
audio out that's e okay yeah I guess I
 

1547
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,710
audio out that's e okay yeah I guess I
would have noticed if we didn't because

1548
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
would have noticed if we didn't because
 

1549
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,669
would have noticed if we didn't because
you'd hear uh you know quite a bit of

1550
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:14,679
you'd hear uh you know quite a bit of
 

1551
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,350
you'd hear uh you know quite a bit of
noisy chatter of uh you whatever else

1552
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
noisy chatter of uh you whatever else
 

1553
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,149
noisy chatter of uh you whatever else
anyone is any one of our clients is

1554
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:19,159
anyone is any one of our clients is
 

1555
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,950
anyone is any one of our clients is
testing at any uh point in time yeah

1556
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:21,960
testing at any uh point in time yeah
 

1557
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,990
testing at any uh point in time yeah
actually that raises the thought that if

1558
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
actually that raises the thought that if
 

1559
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,310
actually that raises the thought that if
you walk into that room at any point it

1560
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
you walk into that room at any point it
 

1561
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,669
you walk into that room at any point it
must be a cacophony different television

1562
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:29,679
must be a cacophony different television
 

1563
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,269
must be a cacophony different television
channels uh yes okay it is but but it's

1564
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
channels uh yes okay it is but but it's
 

1565
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,950
channels uh yes okay it is but but it's
you wouldn't see them because they're in

1566
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:34,960
you wouldn't see them because they're in
 

1567
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,190
you wouldn't see them because they're in
contained in these boxes there's like um

1568
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:38,200
contained in these boxes there's like um
 

1569
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,149
contained in these boxes there's like um
the vent where the fan is you know you

1570
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
the vent where the fan is you know you
 

1571
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,830
the vent where the fan is you know you
can actually see a little bit into the

1572
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:41,840
can actually see a little bit into the
 

1573
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,990
can actually see a little bit into the
box but for the most part it's it's very

1574
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
box but for the most part it's it's very
 

1575
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,549
box but for the most part it's it's very
much enclosed and um you you you'd be

1576
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:47,559
much enclosed and um you you you'd be
 

1577
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,990
much enclosed and um you you you'd be
none the wiser and it's actually pretty

1578
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,000
none the wiser and it's actually pretty
 

1579
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,750
none the wiser and it's actually pretty
quiet U we do have two fans um but

1580
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
quiet U we do have two fans um but
 

1581
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,549
quiet U we do have two fans um but
they're not making a ton of noise

1582
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:53,559
they're not making a ton of noise
 

1583
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:57,149
they're not making a ton of noise
they're um it's a surprisingly quiet

1584
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:57,159
they're um it's a surprisingly quiet
 

1585
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:58,629
they're um it's a surprisingly quiet
operation

1586
00:32:58,629 --> 00:32:58,639
operation
 

1587
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:04,830
operation
Okay Okay so we've got hor these boxes

1588
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:04,840
Okay Okay so we've got hor these boxes
 

1589
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,110
Okay Okay so we've got hor these boxes
that was that was one thing I wanted to

1590
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,120
that was that was one thing I wanted to
 

1591
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,430
that was that was one thing I wanted to
pick you up on you're controlling this

1592
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440
pick you up on you're controlling this
 

1593
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,909
pick you up on you're controlling this
your central controlling software is

1594
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
your central controlling software is
 

1595
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,070
your central controlling software is
erlang right you're running the beam on

1596
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,080
erlang right you're running the beam on
 

1597
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,549
erlang right you're running the beam on
the box that's right why Docker as well

1598
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:17,559
the box that's right why Docker as well
 

1599
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,389
the box that's right why Docker as well
they seem to be slightly overlapping in

1600
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:19,399
they seem to be slightly overlapping in
 

1601
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:24,669
they seem to be slightly overlapping in
what they do they do um so

1602
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:24,679
what they do they do um so
 

1603
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:27,789
what they do they do um so
we we've tried many many many different

1604
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:27,799
we we've tried many many many different
 

1605
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,950
we we've tried many many many different
approaches here um

1606
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:30,960
approaches here um
 

1607
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,350
approaches here um
so this can go into a whole side

1608
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
so this can go into a whole side
 

1609
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,549
so this can go into a whole side
conversation and and I I do need to

1610
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:35,559
conversation and and I I do need to
 

1611
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,669
conversation and and I I do need to
remember that you asked me about how we

1612
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:37,679
remember that you asked me about how we
 

1613
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,070
remember that you asked me about how we
automate working with these televisions

1614
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,080
automate working with these televisions
 

1615
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,669
automate working with these televisions
so we have to work our way back to up

1616
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:40,679
so we have to work our way back to up
 

1617
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,590
so we have to work our way back to up
yeah there we've got

1618
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
yeah there we've got
 

1619
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,269
yeah there we've got
long

1620
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
long
 

1621
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,230
long
um when we first started out um you know

1622
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
um when we first started out um you know
 

1623
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,190
um when we first started out um you know
we we basically just shipping code

1624
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
we we basically just shipping code
 

1625
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,909
we we basically just shipping code
directly onto our compute and you know

1626
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
directly onto our compute and you know
 

1627
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,909
directly onto our compute and you know
running it on there natively um which is

1628
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:56,919
running it on there natively um which is
 

1629
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:59,470
running it on there natively um which is
U very easy and a lot of ways the

1630
00:33:59,470 --> 00:33:59,480
U very easy and a lot of ways the
 

1631
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,950
U very easy and a lot of ways the
problem that we ran into we're we're

1632
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:00,960
problem that we ran into we're we're
 

1633
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,830
problem that we ran into we're we're
building on top of Nvidia hardware and

1634
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:04,840
building on top of Nvidia hardware and
 

1635
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,750
building on top of Nvidia hardware and
the Nvidia Hardware poses a lot of

1636
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
the Nvidia Hardware poses a lot of
 

1637
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,389
the Nvidia Hardware poses a lot of
challenges especially when you're

1638
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:09,399
challenges especially when you're
 

1639
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:11,669
challenges especially when you're
working with Native libraries um so

1640
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
working with Native libraries um so
 

1641
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,430
working with Native libraries um so
we're working with open CV we're working

1642
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:14,440
we're working with open CV we're working
 

1643
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,589
we're working with open CV we're working
with um a technology called gstreamer

1644
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:17,599
with um a technology called gstreamer
 

1645
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,750
with um a technology called gstreamer
for our multimedia pipeline we're

1646
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:19,760
for our multimedia pipeline we're
 

1647
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,990
for our multimedia pipeline we're
working with

1648
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,000
working with
 

1649
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,510
working with
um uh what's some other native stuff

1650
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520
um uh what's some other native stuff
 

1651
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,510
um uh what's some other native stuff
we're doing I mean kind of the machine

1652
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
we're doing I mean kind of the machine
 

1653
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,790
we're doing I mean kind of the machine
learn learning stacks and uh you know a

1654
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:29,800
learn learning stacks and uh you know a
 

1655
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,669
learn learning stacks and uh you know a
bunch of Nvidia specific uh you know GPU

1656
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:32,679
bunch of Nvidia specific uh you know GPU
 

1657
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,710
bunch of Nvidia specific uh you know GPU
stuff uh camera drivers all of this um

1658
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
stuff uh camera drivers all of this um
 

1659
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,190
stuff uh camera drivers all of this um
it becomes very difficult to be able to

1660
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
it becomes very difficult to be able to
 

1661
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,510
it becomes very difficult to be able to
uh ship your software to all these

1662
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,520
uh ship your software to all these
 

1663
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,510
uh ship your software to all these
different places and have it run

1664
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
different places and have it run
 

1665
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,869
different places and have it run
reliably and to make version upgrades

1666
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:47,879
reliably and to make version upgrades
 

1667
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,030
reliably and to make version upgrades
and changes uh doing it natively on the

1668
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
and changes uh doing it natively on the
 

1669
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,510
and changes uh doing it natively on the
box I'm not saying it can't be done um

1670
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:53,520
box I'm not saying it can't be done um
 

1671
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,230
box I'm not saying it can't be done um
but what we found is that Docker just be

1672
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
but what we found is that Docker just be
 

1673
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,310
but what we found is that Docker just be
became a lot simpler for us to be able

1674
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
became a lot simpler for us to be able
 

1675
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,670
became a lot simpler for us to be able
to deploy new software we have a build

1676
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:00,680
to deploy new software we have a build
 

1677
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,270
to deploy new software we have a build
box that's running on uh an Nvidia

1678
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
box that's running on uh an Nvidia
 

1679
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,390
box that's running on uh an Nvidia
Jetson uh somewhere in our office it's

1680
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,400
Jetson uh somewhere in our office it's
 

1681
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,990
Jetson uh somewhere in our office it's
hooked up as a a GitHub action CI Runner

1682
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,000
hooked up as a a GitHub action CI Runner
 

1683
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,030
hooked up as a a GitHub action CI Runner
and we're able to build an image push it

1684
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
and we're able to build an image push it
 

1685
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,589
and we're able to build an image push it
to our local Docker registry all of our

1686
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:13,599
to our local Docker registry all of our
 

1687
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,430
to our local Docker registry all of our
devices uh when they're done with the

1688
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,440
devices uh when they're done with the
 

1689
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,150
devices uh when they're done with the
session pull it down uh you know power

1690
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,160
session pull it down uh you know power
 

1691
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,950
session pull it down uh you know power
cycle themselves and it just becomes a

1692
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:19,960
cycle themselves and it just becomes a
 

1693
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,230
cycle themselves and it just becomes a
very simple way of uh deploying our

1694
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:23,240
very simple way of uh deploying our
 

1695
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,270
very simple way of uh deploying our
software the other challenge that we

1696
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,280
software the other challenge that we
 

1697
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,990
software the other challenge that we
have is that we're running a bunch of

1698
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,000
have is that we're running a bunch of
 

1699
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,750
have is that we're running a bunch of
third party software not all of it is uh

1700
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:30,760
third party software not all of it is uh
 

1701
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,270
third party software not all of it is uh
designed to be run on arm so we have the

1702
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,280
designed to be run on arm so we have the
 

1703
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,589
designed to be run on arm so we have the
problem of how do you emulate certain

1704
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:35,599
problem of how do you emulate certain
 

1705
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,510
problem of how do you emulate certain
software so we've got quu running quu I

1706
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:38,520
software so we've got quu running quu I
 

1707
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,790
software so we've got quu running quu I
don't know how you say that correctly

1708
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:39,800
don't know how you say that correctly
 

1709
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,349
don't know how you say that correctly
but we have I've always wondered q m

1710
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:43,359
but we have I've always wondered q m
 

1711
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,950
but we have I've always wondered q m
that one right the Q emulator Q yeah so

1712
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
that one right the Q emulator Q yeah so
 

1713
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,870
that one right the Q emulator Q yeah so
we have some someone will tell us in the

1714
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:50,880
we have some someone will tell us in the
 

1715
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,230
we have some someone will tell us in the
comments how to pronounce it correctly I

1716
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:53,240
comments how to pronounce it correctly I
 

1717
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,470
comments how to pronounce it correctly I
hope so um because I've been wondering

1718
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:55,480
hope so um because I've been wondering
 

1719
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,349
hope so um because I've been wondering
for for some time now so we have the

1720
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
for for some time now so we have the
 

1721
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,790
for for some time now so we have the
prob of like how do you run this

1722
00:35:59,790 --> 00:35:59,800
prob of like how do you run this
 

1723
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,630
prob of like how do you run this
esoteric uh version of of java 7 or 8 uh

00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
set of challenges um and that maybe
 

1791
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,190
set of challenges um and that maybe
would be useful to use the hot code

1792
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,200
would be useful to use the hot code
 

1793
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,030
would be useful to use the hot code
reloading features of the beam but we

1794
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
reloading features of the beam but we
 

1795
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,710
reloading features of the beam but we
don't actually use that anywhere we try

1796
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
don't actually use that anywhere we try
 

1797
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,109
don't actually use that anywhere we try
and have other different techniques to

1798
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
and have other different techniques to
 

1799
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,230
and have other different techniques to

1800
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:41,240
to make sure that that's reliable and
 

1801
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,510
to make sure that that's reliable and
and works well okay in that case it is

1802
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
and works well okay in that case it is
 

1803
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,270
and works well okay in that case it is
time to zoom out of the box you've now

built a box in which you can shove a

1806
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,079
built a box in which you can shove a
 

1807
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,390
built a box in which you can shove a
television you can tell it things and

television you can tell it things and
 

1809
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,910
television you can tell it things and
you can see what it's showing

1810
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:52,920
you can see what it's showing
 

1811
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,030
you can see what it's showing

what do I do next to build out this

1816
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:01,800
what do I do next to build out this
 

1817
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,829
what do I do next to build out this
service well um the first thing I think

1818
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:05,839
service well um the first thing I think
 

1819
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,390
service well um the first thing I think
before you automate televisions is that

1820
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
before you automate televisions is that
 

1821
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,109
before you automate televisions is that
to know what you're automating it's

1822
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:10,119
to know what you're automating it's
 

1823
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,150
to know what you're automating it's
often very helpful to be able to run

1824
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
often very helpful to be able to run
 

1825
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,630
often very helpful to be able to run
through it yourself so and imagine I'm

1826
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
through it yourself so and imagine I'm
 

1827
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,790
through it yourself so and imagine I'm
sitting here with my remote control look

1828
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:16,800
sitting here with my remote control look
 

1829
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,510
sitting here with my remote control look
at this I have one right here you know

1830
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:18,520
at this I have one right here you know
 

1831
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,470
at this I have one right here you know
so I turn it on I go to the you know the

1832
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:21,480
so I turn it on I go to the you know the
 

1833
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,030
so I turn it on I go to the you know the
page I want to navigate I go to the

1834
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,040
page I want to navigate I go to the
 

1835
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,150
page I want to navigate I go to the
thing and while I'm doing so in my

1836
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
thing and while I'm doing so in my
 

1837
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,230
thing and while I'm doing so in my
platform I'm taking screen shots of this

1838
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,240
platform I'm taking screen shots of this
 

1839
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,150
platform I'm taking screen shots of this
um so we call this our access platform

1840
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:31,160
um so we call this our access platform
 

1841
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,190
um so we call this our access platform
and how this works is our system you say

1842
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,200
and how this works is our system you say
 

1843
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,790
and how this works is our system you say
I want give me any LG and it will pair

1844
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:36,800
I want give me any LG and it will pair
 

1845
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,390
I want give me any LG and it will pair
you with the first available LG it

1846
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
you with the first available LG it
 

1847
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,109
you with the first available LG it
doesn't care um you know what year it is

1848
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:41,119
doesn't care um you know what year it is
 

1849
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,030
doesn't care um you know what year it is
or whatever um whatever constraints you

1850
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,040
or whatever um whatever constraints you
 

1851
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,829
or whatever um whatever constraints you
can make a very broad request just say

1852
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:45,839
can make a very broad request just say
 

1853
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,870
can make a very broad request just say
give me the first thing that's available

1854
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:47,880
give me the first thing that's available
 

1855
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,910
give me the first thing that's available
okay I can go and test on it take those

1856
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:49,920
okay I can go and test on it take those
 

1857
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,750
okay I can go and test on it take those
screenshots uh and now I have a good

1858
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
screenshots uh and now I have a good
 

1859
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,470
screenshots uh and now I have a good
sense of the path for which I want to

1860
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:53,480
sense of the path for which I want to
 

1861
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,910
sense of the path for which I want to
test then I go into our automation uh

1862
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:57,920
test then I go into our automation uh
 

1863
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,270
test then I go into our automation uh
product um this is um a very visual uh

um let's make up an example here um

1878
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:21,400
um let's make up an example here um
 

1879
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,069
um let's make up an example here um
there's there's some um some apps where

1880
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:24,079
there's there's some um some apps where
 

1881
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,069
there's there's some um some apps where
you might have like a channel guide um

1882
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:27,079
you might have like a channel guide um
 

1883
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,470
you might have like a channel guide um
I'm think of one very particular uh app

1884
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:29,480
I'm think of one very particular uh app
 

1885
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,710
I'm think of one very particular uh app
developer but I don't want to use their

1886
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
developer but I don't want to use their
 

1887
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,750
developer but I don't want to use their
name uh so imagine you have like a a

1888
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:32,760
name uh so imagine you have like a a
 

1889
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,470
name uh so imagine you have like a a
channel guide where there's all these

1890
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,480
channel guide where there's all these
 

1891
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,990
channel guide where there's all these
different shows that you could watch on

1892
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
different shows that you could watch on
 

1893
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,510
different shows that you could watch on
their app um and so you want to navigate

1894
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:38,520
their app um and so you want to navigate
 

1895
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,589
their app um and so you want to navigate
over to that you want to pick a

1896
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:40,599
over to that you want to pick a
 

1897
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,950
over to that you want to pick a
particular show you want to watch it you

1898
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
particular show you want to watch it you
 

1899
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,910
particular show you want to watch it you
then want to pause it and test that when

1900
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:44,920
then want to pause it and test that when
 

1901
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,870
then want to pause it and test that when
you scrub back and forward that it

1902
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:46,880
you scrub back and forward that it
 

1903
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,230
you scrub back and forward that it
actually moves you back through content

1904
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,240
actually moves you back through content
 

1905
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,990
actually moves you back through content
and then when you hit play it serves you

1906
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,000
and then when you hit play it serves you
 

1907
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,950
and then when you hit play it serves you
an ad that seems like a very reasonable

1908
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:53,960
an ad that seems like a very reasonable
 

1909
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,069
an ad that seems like a very reasonable
thing to want test yes so the way that

1910
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
thing to want test yes so the way that
 

1911
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,190
thing to want test yes so the way that
this works in our platform um because

1912
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:00,200
this works in our platform um because
 

1913
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,309
this works in our platform um because
we're trying to Target across all these

1914
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:02,319
we're trying to Target across all these
 

1915
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:04,990
we're trying to Target across all these
different devices using something like

1916
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,000
different devices using something like
 

1917
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,990
different devices using something like
you know HTML you know hooking into your

1918
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,000
you know HTML you know hooking into your
 

1919
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,990
you know HTML you know hooking into your
code or using you know the structure of

1920
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,000
code or using you know the structure of
 

1921
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,230
code or using you know the structure of
HTML to test semantic things um in the

1922
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:13,240
HTML to test semantic things um in the
 

1923
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,510
HTML to test semantic things um in the
Dom it just doesn't work well for this

1924
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,520
Dom it just doesn't work well for this
 

1925
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,670
Dom it just doesn't work well for this
type of testing um and so we've taken

1926
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
type of testing um and so we've taken
 

1927
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,750
type of testing um and so we've taken
this very visual based approach where um

1928
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:20,760
this very visual based approach where um
 

1929
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,790
this very visual based approach where um
you kind of tell the system you give it

1930
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
you kind of tell the system you give it
 

1931
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,430
you kind of tell the system you give it
visual cues

1932
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:24,440
visual cues
 

1933
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,470
visual cues
for you know if this um this logo if it

1934
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:28,480
for you know if this um this logo if it
 

1935
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,589
for you know if this um this logo if it
appears on this Pace on the on the this

1936
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
appears on this Pace on the on the this
 

1937
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,069
appears on this Pace on the on the this
place on the page and there's this text

1938
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
place on the page and there's this text
 

1939
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,790
place on the page and there's this text
that says uh you know home in this

1940
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
that says uh you know home in this
 

1941
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,750
that says uh you know home in this
particular part of the screen and this

1942
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:38,760
particular part of the screen and this
 

1943
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,069
particular part of the screen and this
thing is uh dominantly you know this

1944
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:41,079
thing is uh dominantly you know this
 

1945
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,390
thing is uh dominantly you know this
particular color of yellow over here I

1946
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:43,400
particular color of yellow over here I
 

1947
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,349
particular color of yellow over here I
have a pretty good idea that I'm on the

1948
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359
have a pretty good idea that I'm on the
 

1949
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,230
have a pretty good idea that I'm on the
homepage so right so

1950
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:49,240
homepage so right so
 

1951
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,270
homepage so right so
you where you are right so our system

1952
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
you where you are right so our system
 

1953
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,910
you where you are right so our system
can then take that and uh

1954
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:57,920
can then take that and uh
 

1955
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,750
can then take that and uh
it will be able to to you know process

1956
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
it will be able to to you know process
 

1957
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,670
it will be able to to you know process
every frame and then look in those

1958
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:01,680
every frame and then look in those
 

1959
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,589
every frame and then look in those
rectangles that you drew and say what am

1960
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:03,599
rectangles that you drew and say what am
 

1961
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,829
rectangles that you drew and say what am
I seeing here am I seeing you know this

1962
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:05,839
I seeing here am I seeing you know this
 

1963
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,630
I seeing here am I seeing you know this
particular piece of text so I'll be

1964
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:07,640
particular piece of text so I'll be
 

1965
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,030
particular piece of text so I'll be
running you know different types of

1966
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
running you know different types of
 

1967
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,710
running you know different types of
machine learning to pull this

1968
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:10,720
machine learning to pull this
 

1969
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,510
machine learning to pull this
information out you know pulling

1970
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:12,520
information out you know pulling
 

1971
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,750
information out you know pulling
bounding boxes and uh you know using OCR

1972
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:15,760
bounding boxes and uh you know using OCR
 

1973
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,710
bounding boxes and uh you know using OCR
to grab

1974
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:16,720
to grab
 

1975
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,109
to grab
text um from that you can build a

1976
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:20,119
text um from that you can build a
 

1977
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,990
text um from that you can build a
workflow so we have just drag and drop

1978
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
workflow so we have just drag and drop
 

1979
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,270
workflow so we have just drag and drop
tool and you'll do something like open

1980
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:24,280
tool and you'll do something like open
 

1981
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,150
tool and you'll do something like open
this app wait for the homepage to load

1982
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,160
this app wait for the homepage to load
 

1983
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,430
this app wait for the homepage to load
check am I logged in or am I logged out

1984
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
check am I logged in or am I logged out
 

1985
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,270
check am I logged in or am I logged out
based on the presence of you know the

1986
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:34,280
based on the presence of you know the
 

1987
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,150
based on the presence of you know the
the login model yeah if I'm if I'm

1988
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,160
the login model yeah if I'm if I'm
 

1989
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,950
the login model yeah if I'm if I'm
logged out go through this workflow if

1990
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:38,960
logged out go through this workflow if
 

1991
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,550
logged out go through this workflow if
I'm logged out go for this other

1992
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,560
I'm logged out go for this other
 

1993
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,910
I'm logged out go for this other
workflow okay now I'm logged in now I

1994
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:42,920
workflow okay now I'm logged in now I
 

1995
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,390
workflow okay now I'm logged in now I
need to go to that channel page that we

1996
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:44,400
need to go to that channel page that we
 

1997
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,190
need to go to that channel page that we
talked about so issue these set of

1998
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
talked about so issue these set of
 

1999
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,390
talked about so issue these set of
commands um use you know generative AI

2000
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:50,400
commands um use you know generative AI
 

2001
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,829
commands um use you know generative AI
to you know navigate around the screen

2002
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:52,839
to you know navigate around the screen
 

2003
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:54,109
to you know navigate around the screen
uh because now maybe there's some

2004
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:54,119
uh because now maybe there's some
 

2005
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,430
uh because now maybe there's some
complex menu that I need to navigate and

2006
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:56,440
complex menu that I need to navigate and
 

2007
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,150
complex menu that I need to navigate and
the content change es dynamically so you

2008
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,160
the content change es dynamically so you
 

2009
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,750
the content change es dynamically so you
know we'll grab a frame we'll generate

2010
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:01,760
know we'll grab a frame we'll generate
 

2011
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,550
know we'll grab a frame we'll generate
the series of the sequence of up down

2012
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560
the series of the sequence of up down
 

2013
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,270
the series of the sequence of up down
left rights and enters to get to where

2014
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:06,280
left rights and enters to get to where
 

2015
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,550
left rights and enters to get to where
you need to go um then we'll use our uh

2016
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:10,560
you need to go um then we'll use our uh
 

2017
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,430
you need to go um then we'll use our uh
Vision based system to the video starts

2018
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440
Vision based system to the video starts
 

2019
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,030
Vision based system to the video starts
playing we're grabbing frames and um our

2020
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,040
playing we're grabbing frames and um our
 

2021
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,470
playing we're grabbing frames and um our
system can kind of understand the

2022
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:17,480
system can kind of understand the
 

2023
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,390
system can kind of understand the
content that's playing and be able to

2024
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:19,400
content that's playing and be able to
 

2025
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,470
content that's playing and be able to
draw some certain types of information

2026
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:21,480
draw some certain types of information
 

2027
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,069
draw some certain types of information
from it and then you know we can detect

2028
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:24,079
from it and then you know we can detect
 

2029
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,230
from it and then you know we can detect
the ad based on maybe some content or

2030
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,240
the ad based on maybe some content or
 

2031
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,309
the ad based on maybe some content or
the presence of you know some text on

2032
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,319
the presence of you know some text on
 

2033
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,030
the presence of you know some text on
the screen uh or maybe we know the ad or

2034
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
the screen uh or maybe we know the ad or
 

2035
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,349
the screen uh or maybe we know the ad or
we can fake it by you know intercepting

2036
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
we can fake it by you know intercepting
 

2037
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,630
we can fake it by you know intercepting
the network uh and so you can do

2038
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:35,640
the network uh and so you can do
 

2039
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,390
the network uh and so you can do
assertions in our platform based on that

2040
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,400
assertions in our platform based on that
 

2041
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,390
assertions in our platform based on that
um so this whole visual system is kind

2042
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
um so this whole visual system is kind
 

2043
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,069
um so this whole visual system is kind
of how we can pose these tests together

2044
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:43,079
of how we can pose these tests together
 

2045
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,109
of how we can pose these tests together
right pause there for a second right

2046
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
right pause there for a second right
 

2047
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,430
right pause there for a second right
yeah

2048
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440
yeah
 

2049
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,230
yeah
so so I I do this markup stage first

2050
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,240
so so I I do this markup stage first
 

2051
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,549
so so I I do this markup stage first
before I manually against one known

2052
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:55,559
before I manually against one known
 

2053
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:58,309
before I manually against one known
television and then I can script out the

2054
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:58,319
television and then I can script out the
 

2055
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,069
television and then I can script out the
whole thing which you will then compile

2056
00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:01,079
whole thing which you will then compile
 

2057
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,829
whole thing which you will then compile
down and send to the individual

2058
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:04,839
down and send to the individual
 

2059
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,630
down and send to the individual
container so you found me because of Lua

2060
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:07,640
container so you found me because of Lua
 

2061
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,990
container so you found me because of Lua
on the beam and this is where this

2062
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:09,000
on the beam and this is where this
 

2063
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,910
on the beam and this is where this
enters the picture right okay

2064
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:12,920
enters the picture right okay
 

2065
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,710
enters the picture right okay
so uh I'm trying to describe this to you

2066
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:15,720
so uh I'm trying to describe this to you
 

2067
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,829
so uh I'm trying to describe this to you
uh without a visual aid but we have this

2068
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:17,839
uh without a visual aid but we have this
 

2069
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,870
uh without a visual aid but we have this
drag and drop workflow Builder right and

2070
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:20,880
drag and drop workflow Builder right and
 

2071
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,349
drag and drop workflow Builder right and
as I said open app wait for the screen

2072
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:24,359
as I said open app wait for the screen
 

2073
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,230
as I said open app wait for the screen
enter these series of commands maybe use

2074
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
enter these series of commands maybe use
 

2075
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,030
enter these series of commands maybe use
the keyboard to enter some text to

2076
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:28,040
the keyboard to enter some text to
 

2077
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,309
the keyboard to enter some text to
search for a particular piece of content

2078
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
search for a particular piece of content
 

2079
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,230
search for a particular piece of content
you could do it all through this visual

2080
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
you could do it all through this visual
 

2081
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,230
you could do it all through this visual

workflow make certain assertions um you

2108
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520
workflow make certain assertions um you

2113
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,790
do um and then adid events back up to
our web platform that then get

2114
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:17,800
our web platform that then get
 

2115
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,829
our web platform that then get
visualized for you and you have this

2116
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:19,839
visualized for you and you have this
 

2117
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,470
visualized for you and you have this
like really um interesting visual way of

2118
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480
like really um interesting visual way of
 

2119
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,150
like really um interesting visual way of
seeing not just the recorded video of

2120
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:27,160
seeing not just the recorded video of
 

2121
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,790
seeing not just the recorded video of
your test being run but the state of the

2122
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:29,800
your test being run but the state of the
 

2123
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,030
your test being run but the state of the
system as it's running through that so

2124
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:32,040
system as it's running through that so
 

2125
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,309
system as it's running through that so
the system will be like okay right now I

2126
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
the system will be like okay right now I
 

2127
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,230
the system will be like okay right now I
know that we're on the homepage based on

00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
know that we're on the homepage based on
 

2129
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,430
know that we're on the homepage based on
what you've told me about the homepage

2130
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:38,440
what you've told me about the homepage
 

2131
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,349
what you've told me about the homepage
uh these are this is the network uh

2132
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:40,359
uh these are this is the network uh
 

2133
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:42,069
uh these are this is the network uh
activity while this is happening this is

2134
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
activity while this is happening this is
 

2135
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,829
activity while this is happening this is
the Audio Level while this is happening

2136
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:44,839
the Audio Level while this is happening
 

2137
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:46,510
the Audio Level while this is happening
uh these are the you know elements on

2138
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:46,520
uh these are the you know elements on
 

2139
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,950
uh these are the you know elements on
the screen that you've told me about I

2140
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
the screen that you've told me about I
 

2141
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,750
the screen that you've told me about I
recognize the presence of this thing

2142
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:50,760
recognize the presence of this thing
 

2143
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,630
recognize the presence of this thing
this thing is not here and from this you

2144
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:53,640
this thing is not here and from this you
 

2145
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,309
this thing is not here and from this you
could build this really um powerful way

2146
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:56,319
could build this really um powerful way
 

2147
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,150
could build this really um powerful way
of navigating and making assertions

2148
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:58,160
of navigating and making assertions
 

2149
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,190
of navigating and making assertions
about content and then reporting it and

2150
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,200
about content and then reporting it and
 

2151
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,990
about content and then reporting it and
being able to see changes between

2152
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:03,000
being able to see changes between
 

2153
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,510
being able to see changes between
different

2154
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:04,520
different
 

2155
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,510
different
runs okay so if I then go to test this

2156
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:08,520
runs okay so if I then go to test this
 

2157
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,190
runs okay so if I then go to test this
against a dozen different kinds of

2158
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,200
against a dozen different kinds of
 

2159
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,750
against a dozen different kinds of
Television am I going to be able to step

2160
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760
Television am I going to be able to step
 

2161
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,630
Television am I going to be able to step
through and say okay they all made it to

2162
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:15,640
through and say okay they all made it to
 

2163
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,390
through and say okay they all made it to
the login page they all made it to the

2164
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:19,400
the login page they all made it to the
 

2165
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,270
the login page they all made it to the
CH channel guide page but one of them

2166
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:22,280
CH channel guide page but one of them
 

2167
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,349
CH channel guide page but one of them
didn't make it past the channel gu guide

2168
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:24,359
didn't make it past the channel gu guide
 

2169
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:26,510
didn't make it past the channel gu guide
page and got stuck and that's the one I

2170
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:26,520
page and got stuck and that's the one I
 

2171
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,670
page and got stuck and that's the one I
need to do testing on so when you when

2172
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
need to do testing on so when you when
 

2173
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,790
need to do testing on so when you when
you write a test on our platform you can

2174
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:31,800
you write a test on our platform you can
 

2175
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,950
you write a test on our platform you can
then schedule it and say I want this to

2176
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:33,960
then schedule it and say I want this to
 

2177
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,630
then schedule it and say I want this to
run on these five different devices and

2178
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:37,640
run on these five different devices and
 

2179
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,910
run on these five different devices and
because it's Visual and because most of

2180
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:39,920
because it's Visual and because most of
 

2181
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,790
because it's Visual and because most of
the time uh the look and feel of these

2182
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:42,800
the time uh the look and feel of these
 

2183
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,190
the time uh the look and feel of these
apps is pretty consistent across devices

2184
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,200
apps is pretty consistent across devices
 

2185
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,230
apps is pretty consistent across devices
this becomes pretty powerful for writing

2186
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:47,240
this becomes pretty powerful for writing
 

2187
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,390
this becomes pretty powerful for writing
these um endtoend tests uh in that are

2188
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:51,400
these um endtoend tests uh in that are
 

2189
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,309
these um endtoend tests uh in that are
implemented in completely different

2190
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:53,319
implemented in completely different
 

2191
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:55,309
implemented in completely different
Technologies and so what you're pointing

2192
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:55,319
Technologies and so what you're pointing
 

2193
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,030
Technologies and so what you're pointing
out is that you can find inconsistencies

2194
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:58,040
out is that you can find inconsistencies
 

2195
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,750
out is that you can find inconsistencies
in implementation or bugs or maybe

2196
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:00,760
in implementation or bugs or maybe
 

2197
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,309
in implementation or bugs or maybe
slowness or buffering or just some issue

2198
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:03,319
slowness or buffering or just some issue
 

2199
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:05,390
slowness or buffering or just some issue
that you weren't expecting on one

2200
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:05,400
that you weren't expecting on one
 

2201
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,829
that you weren't expecting on one
particular device um and so you might

2202
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
particular device um and so you might
 

2203
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,349
particular device um and so you might
run this test and you might run it

2204
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:09,359
run this test and you might run it
 

2205
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,549
run this test and you might run it
against you know I make a code change in

2206
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:11,559
against you know I make a code change in
 

2207
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,510
against you know I make a code change in
my app I'm G to sideload a build uh

2208
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:14,520
my app I'm G to sideload a build uh
 

2209
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,390
my app I'm G to sideload a build uh
through the tvls platform on my CI it

2210
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:17,400
through the tvls platform on my CI it
 

2211
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,470
through the tvls platform on my CI it
then runs on these devices and it

2212
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:19,480
then runs on these devices and it
 

2213
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,589
then runs on these devices and it
reports back to you it worked great on

2214
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:21,599
reports back to you it worked great on
 

2215
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,630
reports back to you it worked great on
Panasonic it worked great on Sony it

2216
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:23,640
Panasonic it worked great on Sony it
 

2217
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,030
Panasonic it worked great on Sony it
worked great on Samsung but on Fire TV

2218
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:26,040
worked great on Samsung but on Fire TV
 

2219
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,430
worked great on Samsung but on Fire TV
you had this issue

2220
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:27,440
you had this issue
 

2221
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,470
you had this issue
and then you can go in see the recording

2222
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:29,480
and then you can go in see the recording
 

2223
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,109
and then you can go in see the recording
see what the system was doing as it was

2224
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:32,119
see what the system was doing as it was
 

2225
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:34,309
see what the system was doing as it was
navigating through your test and then

2226
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
navigating through your test and then
 

2227
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,309
navigating through your test and then
you have all this information including

2228
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:36,319
you have all this information including
 

2229
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,670
you have all this information including
you know the device logs and kind of all

2230
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:38,680
you know the device logs and kind of all
 

2231
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,710
you know the device logs and kind of all
the Telemetry that we're collecting also

2232
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:40,720
the Telemetry that we're collecting also
 

2233
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,870
the Telemetry that we're collecting also
networking Network calls and things like

2234
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
networking Network calls and things like
 

2235
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,510
networking Network calls and things like
that that you can go and inspect and

2236
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:45,520
that that you can go and inspect and
 

2237
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,470
that that you can go and inspect and
figure out what went wrong and maybe go

2238
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:47,480
figure out what went wrong and maybe go
 

2239
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,470
figure out what went wrong and maybe go
into your logs and correlate some sort

2240
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:49,480
into your logs and correlate some sort
 

2241
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,230
into your logs and correlate some sort
of issue yeah cuz remembering the the

2242
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:52,240
of issue yeah cuz remembering the the
 

2243
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,910
of issue yeah cuz remembering the the
bad old days of the browser Wars I my

2244
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:55,920
bad old days of the browser Wars I my
 

2245
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,510
bad old days of the browser Wars I my
expectation would be that it fails on

2246
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:58,520
expectation would be that it fails on
 

2247
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,990
expectation would be that it fails on
something most of the time for some dumb

2248
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,000
something most of the time for some dumb
 

2249
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,069
something most of the time for some dumb
reason mhm right and you

2250
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:05,079
reason mhm right and you
 

2251
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:07,190
reason mhm right and you
yeah okay

2252
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,200
yeah okay
 

2253
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,670
yeah okay
so I've

2254
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:09,680
so I've
 

2255
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,549
so I've
never I've never really been happy with

2256
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:12,559
never I've never really been happy with
 

2257
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,990
never I've never really been happy with
this kind of front end testing because

2258
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:15,000
this kind of front end testing because
 

2259
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,349
this kind of front end testing because
it's always fiddly and messy but that

2260
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:17,359
it's always fiddly and messy but that
 

2261
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,829
it's always fiddly and messy but that
doesn't

2262
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:18,839
doesn't
 

2263
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,870
doesn't
sound if if if it doesn't sound ideal it

2264
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:21,880
sound if if if it doesn't sound ideal it
 

2265
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,510
sound if if if it doesn't sound ideal it
at least sounds like we're approaching

2266
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:23,520
at least sounds like we're approaching
 

2267
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,829
at least sounds like we're approaching
the best that can be

2268
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
the best that can be
 

2269
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,870
the best that can be
done is that fair to say I I think so I

2270
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:29,880
done is that fair to say I I think so I
 

2271
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,990
done is that fair to say I I think so I
think the ideal experience is that you

2272
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,000
think the ideal experience is that you
 

2273
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,150
think the ideal experience is that you
have um something akin to you know open

2274
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:37,160
have um something akin to you know open
 

2275
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,150
have um something akin to you know open
Telemetry running inside of your actual

2276
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
Telemetry running inside of your actual
 

2277
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,270
Telemetry running inside of your actual
app and you have all the traces and um

2278
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
app and you have all the traces and um
 

2279
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,230
app and you have all the traces and um
you know everything that you might need

2280
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:45,240
you know everything that you might need
 

2281
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,870
you know everything that you might need
uh to be able to debug the issue and you

2282
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:47,880
uh to be able to debug the issue and you
 

2283
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,630
uh to be able to debug the issue and you
might actually have that um and you

2284
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
might actually have that um and you
 

2285
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,990
might actually have that um and you
might have that in production you'll

2286
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
might have that in production you'll
 

2287
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,790
might have that in production you'll
have you know your analytic systems that

2288
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:53,800
have you know your analytic systems that
 

2289
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,430
have you know your analytic systems that
can do measurements um but we're talking

2290
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:56,440
can do measurements um but we're talking
 

2291
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,230
can do measurements um but we're talking
about uh many different stages in the

2292
00:47:59,230 --> 00:47:59,240
about uh many different stages in the
 

2293
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,190
about uh many different stages in the
software development life cycle um and

2294
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:02,200
software development life cycle um and
 

2295
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,670
software development life cycle um and
you also have to think of the uh volume

2296
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
you also have to think of the uh volume
 

2297
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,950
you also have to think of the uh volume
of changes and the audience and the

2298
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:07,960
of changes and the audience and the
 

2299
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,349
of changes and the audience and the
fragmentation of where all these apps

2300
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:10,359
fragmentation of where all these apps
 

2301
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:12,510
fragmentation of where all these apps
are going you know they might be going

2302
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:12,520
are going you know they might be going
 

2303
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,109
are going you know they might be going
on uh I don't I actually don't even know

2304
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:16,119
on uh I don't I actually don't even know
 

2305
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:18,030
on uh I don't I actually don't even know
the count but it could be hundreds or

2306
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,040
the count but it could be hundreds or
 

2307
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,630
the count but it could be hundreds or
you know I don't think thousands but

2308
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:19,640
you know I don't think thousands but
 

2309
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,349
you know I don't think thousands but
maybe hundreds of different Target

2310
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
maybe hundreds of different Target
 

2311
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,630
maybe hundreds of different Target
platforms with slightly different

2312
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
platforms with slightly different
 

2313
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,270
platforms with slightly different
versions and things like this we have

2314
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:24,280
versions and things like this we have
 

2315
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,390
versions and things like this we have
the same problem in browsers but the the

2316
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:26,400
the same problem in browsers but the the
 

2317
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,750
the same problem in browsers but the the
tech techology is more consistent um

2318
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:29,760
tech techology is more consistent um
 

2319
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,549
tech techology is more consistent um
yeah yeah so solving these problems um

2320
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
yeah yeah so solving these problems um
 

2321
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,309
yeah yeah so solving these problems um
is very challenging and the point that

2322
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
is very challenging and the point that
 

2323
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,109
is very challenging and the point that
we're trying to come in is that we can

2324
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:38,119
we're trying to come in is that we can
 

2325
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,790
we're trying to come in is that we can
help you in any different part of the

2326
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:39,800
help you in any different part of the
 

2327
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,270
help you in any different part of the
software development life cycle uh and

2328
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:42,280
software development life cycle uh and
 

2329
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,069
software development life cycle uh and
we're trying to provide you tools that

2330
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:44,079
we're trying to provide you tools that
 

2331
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,870
we're trying to provide you tools that
provide all this different Telemetry

2332
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:45,880
provide all this different Telemetry
 

2333
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,230
provide all this different Telemetry
where when things are flaky which they

2334
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:48,240
where when things are flaky which they
 

2335
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,270
where when things are flaky which they
will be um we can give you more

2336
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,280
will be um we can give you more
 

2337
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,470
will be um we can give you more
indication for why they're flaky was it

2338
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:53,480
indication for why they're flaky was it
 

2339
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,870
indication for why they're flaky was it
because the network was um being finicky

2340
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
because the network was um being finicky

2346
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:04,760
because on this one particular platform
 

2347
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,349
because on this one particular platform
you actually do have a legitimate bug

2348
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:06,359
you actually do have a legitimate bug
 

2349
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,230
you actually do have a legitimate bug
that you need to fix um we're trying to

2350
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:09,240
that you need to fix um we're trying to
 

2351
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,030
that you need to fix um we're trying to
help you isolate those and to be able to

2352
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,040
help you isolate those and to be able to
 

2353
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,150
help you isolate those and to be able to
run it on these different platforms so

2354
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:13,160
run it on these different platforms so
 

2355
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,750
run it on these different platforms so
that you can find these inconsistencies

2356
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:15,760
that you can find these inconsistencies
 

2357
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,990
that you can find these inconsistencies
and be able to fix them without having

2358
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:18,000
and be able to fix them without having
 

2359
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,829
and be able to fix them without having
to manage this massive Fleet of hardware

2360
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:20,839
to manage this massive Fleet of hardware
 

2361
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:23,109
to manage this massive Fleet of hardware
and have uh you know an operations team

2362
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:23,119
and have uh you know an operations team
 

2363
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,349
and have uh you know an operations team
to manage it we we try to do that solve

2364
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
to manage it we we try to do that solve
 

2365
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,150
to manage it we we try to do that solve
all those problems for you yeah yeah I I

2366
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:28,160
all those problems for you yeah yeah I I
 

2367
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,470
all those problems for you yeah yeah I I
see that as the as the business pitch

2368
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,480
see that as the as the business pitch
 

2369
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,829
see that as the as the business pitch
yeah and it makes sense right because

2370
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
yeah and it makes sense right because
 

2371
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,950
yeah and it makes sense right because
that's that would be hard to do inhouse

2372
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
that's that would be hard to do inhouse
 

2373
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,150
that's that would be hard to do inhouse
unless you're one of the huge players in

2374
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:37,160
unless you're one of the huge players in
 

2375
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,309
unless you're one of the huge players in
which case you're probably going to end

2376
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:38,319
which case you're probably going to end
 

2377
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,150
which case you're probably going to end
up trying to solve the same problems

2378
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:40,160
up trying to solve the same problems
 

2379
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,470
up trying to solve the same problems
that you're solving or just thr at it

2380
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:43,480
that you're solving or just thr at it
 

2381
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,950
that you're solving or just thr at it
yeah and even if you have you know the

2382
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:45,960
yeah and even if you have you know the
 

2383
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,510
yeah and even if you have you know the
budget to throw a lot of money at it

2384
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
budget to throw a lot of money at it
 

2385
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,990
budget to throw a lot of money at it
these are really challenging uh

2386
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,000
these are really challenging uh
 

2387
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,750
these are really challenging uh

our biggest challenges that we have to
 

2443
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,950
our biggest challenges that we have to
overcome which is can we really you know

2444
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
overcome which is can we really you know
 

2445
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,950
overcome which is can we really you know

able to infer um any different one of

2454
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:14,760
able to infer um any different one of
 

2455
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,190
able to infer um any different one of
these things um there's a feedback loop

2456
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:18,200
these things um there's a feedback loop
 

2457
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,950
these things um there's a feedback loop
there which is if I press left what

2458
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:20,960
there which is if I press left what
 

2459
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,950
there which is if I press left what
changes on the screen am I able to

2460
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:22,960
changes on the screen am I able to
 

2461
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,789
changes on the screen am I able to
recognize what is actually you know

2462
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:24,799
recognize what is actually you know
 

2463

currently highlighted on the screen uh
 

2465
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,710
currently highlighted on the screen uh
to some extent we're able to do that to

2466
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:28,720
to some extent we're able to do that to
 

2467
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,430
to some extent we're able to do that to
other extent it's really specific to the

2468
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,440
other extent it's really specific to the
 

2469
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,910
other extent it's really specific to the
app and the platform you're on this

2470
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:32,920
app and the platform you're on this
 

2471
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,349
app and the platform you're on this
might be uh as you said I'm imagining

2472
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:35,359
might be uh as you said I'm imagining
 

2473
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,270
might be uh as you said I'm imagining
these like uh kind of like sidebar

2474
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:38,280
these like uh kind of like sidebar
 

2475
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,309
these like uh kind of like sidebar
navigation things where these things

2476
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:40,319
navigation things where these things
 

2477
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,270
navigation things where these things
like pop into existence that you didn't

2478
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:42,280
like pop into existence that you didn't
 

2479
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,470
like pop into existence that you didn't
expect and you know jump over uh or

2480
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:45,480
expect and you know jump over uh or
 

2481
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,870
expect and you know jump over uh or
sometimes you hit left and it just stays

2482
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
sometimes you hit left and it just stays
 

2483
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,750
sometimes you hit left and it just stays
exactly in in the same place and it's

2484
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:48,760
exactly in in the same place and it's
 

2485
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,349
exactly in in the same place and it's
only when you hit the back button does

2486
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:50,359
only when you hit the back button does
 

2487
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:52,390
only when you hit the back button does
it jump you back to the menu yeah crazy

2488
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
it jump you back to the menu yeah crazy
 

2489
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,589
it jump you back to the menu yeah crazy
navigation and TV app it's definitely a

2490
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:54,599
navigation and TV app it's definitely a
 

2491
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,630
navigation and TV app it's definitely a
thing yes so I I think this problem is

2492
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:57,640
thing yes so I I think this problem is
 

2493
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,309
thing yes so I I think this problem is
solved um over time by being able to

2494
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:01,319
solved um over time by being able to
 

2495
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:07,349
solved um over time by being able to
train on um an agent that is able to

2496
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:07,359
train on um an agent that is able to
 

2497
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,910
train on um an agent that is able to
um be anchored at any one point in the

2498
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:09,920
um be anchored at any one point in the
 

2499
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,470
um be anchored at any one point in the
screen make a change observe what

2500
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
screen make a change observe what
 

2501
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,430
screen make a change observe what
changes on the screen and then uh if it

2502
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,440
changes on the screen and then uh if it
 

2503
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,030
changes on the screen and then uh if it
has the ability to infer uh what are the

2504
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:18,040
has the ability to infer uh what are the
 

2505
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,470
has the ability to infer uh what are the
pieces of content that are navigatable

2506
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:20,480
pieces of content that are navigatable
 

2507
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,670
pieces of content that are navigatable
clickable uh you can sort of build like

2508
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:22,680
clickable uh you can sort of build like
 

2509
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,670
clickable uh you can sort of build like
a graph of understanding of this is how

2510
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:25,680
a graph of understanding of this is how
 

2511
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,150
a graph of understanding of this is how
I move across the app um and if you can

2512
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
I move across the app um and if you can
 

2513
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,510
I move across the app um and if you can
do this with enough uh time and enough

2514
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:31,520
do this with enough uh time and enough
 

2515
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,950
do this with enough uh time and enough
uh examples you can actually build a

2516
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:33,960
uh examples you can actually build a
 

2517
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,910
uh examples you can actually build a
whole map of how to get from point A to

2518
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
whole map of how to get from point A to
 

2519
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,750
whole map of how to get from point A to
point B uh through enough of these

2520
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:38,760
point B uh through enough of these
 

2521
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,710
point B uh through enough of these
iterations so I think that's kind of the

2522
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720
iterations so I think that's kind of the
 

2523
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,109
iterations so I think that's kind of the
goal is if we can automate that then we

2524
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
goal is if we can automate that then we
 

2525
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,990
goal is if we can automate that then we
have a really powerful system that could

2526
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:45,000
have a really powerful system that could
 

2527
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,190
have a really powerful system that could
actually probably crawl your your TV app

2528
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:48,200
actually probably crawl your your TV app
 

2529
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,789
actually probably crawl your your TV app
and find your issues for you but we're

2530
00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:50,799
and find your issues for you but we're
 

2531
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:53,430
and find your issues for you but we're
not not quite there yet today I can see

2532
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:53,440
not not quite there yet today I can see
 

2533
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,190
not not quite there yet today I can see
how you've got the training data if not

2534
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:55,200
how you've got the training data if not
 

2535
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,150
how you've got the training data if not
yet the solution that's right okay so I

2536
00:52:59,150 --> 00:52:59,160
yet the solution that's right okay so I
 

2537
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,430
yet the solution that's right okay so I
think we should then get into uh

2538
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
think we should then get into uh
 

2539
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,030
think we should then get into uh
scheduling because this is clearly a

2540
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
scheduling because this is clearly a
 

2541
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,349
scheduling because this is clearly a
problem how many different kinds of TV

2542
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,359
problem how many different kinds of TV
 

2543
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,710
problem how many different kinds of TV
you actually have in in the

2544
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
you actually have in in the
 

2545
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,390
you actually have in in the
warehouse what kind of are we talking

2546
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:11,400
warehouse what kind of are we talking
 

2547
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,670
warehouse what kind of are we talking
about um I don't want to reveal too many

2548
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:14,680
about um I don't want to reveal too many
 

2549
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,150
about um I don't want to reveal too many
numbers I would say give power of

2550
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:17,160
numbers I would say give power of
 

2551
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,190
numbers I would say give power of
10 we'll be in the hundreds um hundreds

2552
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:20,200
10 we'll be in the hundreds um hundreds
 

2553
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,630
10 we'll be in the hundreds um hundreds
okay the challenge that we have

2554
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:23,640
okay the challenge that we have
 

2555
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,230
okay the challenge that we have
is it's not just about like different

2556
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:26,240
is it's not just about like different
 

2557
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,270
is it's not just about like different
typ YP of device because for any given

2558
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:30,280
typ YP of device because for any given
 

2559
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,510
typ YP of device because for any given
manufacturer they probably have a

2560
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:32,520
manufacturer they probably have a
 

2561
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,549
manufacturer they probably have a
low-end

2562
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:33,559
low-end
 

2563
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:36,430
low-end
television medium and uh you know

2564
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:36,440
television medium and uh you know
 

2565
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,789
television medium and uh you know
high-end device at all different price

2566
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:38,799
high-end device at all different price
 

2567
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,589
high-end device at all different price
points they also have them at all

2568
00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:40,599
points they also have them at all
 

2569
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:42,349
points they also have them at all
different sizes and then different

2570
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:42,359
different sizes and then different
 

2571
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:44,910
different sizes and then different
capabilities maybe some are built

2572
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:44,920
capabilities maybe some are built
 

2573
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,069
capabilities maybe some are built
for uh something called like uh oh man

2574
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:48,079
for uh something called like uh oh man
 

2575
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,750
for uh something called like uh oh man
I'm blanking on this there's a new

2576
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:49,760
I'm blanking on this there's a new
 

2577
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,589
I'm blanking on this there's a new
standard for streaming that has kind of

2578
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
standard for streaming that has kind of
 

2579
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,990
standard for streaming that has kind of
GNA disrupt App Stores um and there's

2580
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,000
GNA disrupt App Stores um and there's
 

2581
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,109
GNA disrupt App Stores um and there's
something called 3.0 atsc 3 3.0 which is

2582
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:58,119
something called 3.0 atsc 3 3.0 which is
 

2583
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:01,190
something called 3.0 atsc 3 3.0 which is
a combination of broadcast and you know

2584
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,200
a combination of broadcast and you know
 

2585
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,910
a combination of broadcast and you know
Internet Protocol coming together so you

2586
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:03,920
Internet Protocol coming together so you
 

2587
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,430
Internet Protocol coming together so you
might have certain devices that have

2588
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
might have certain devices that have
 

2589
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,910
might have certain devices that have
these capabilities that I think are

2590
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:06,920
these capabilities that I think are
 

2591
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,230
these capabilities that I think are
called NextGen televisions you'll

2592
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:09,240
called NextGen televisions you'll
 

2593
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,470
called NextGen televisions you'll
probably be hearing about this in the

2594
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
probably be hearing about this in the
 

2595
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,990
probably be hearing about this in the
next few years right

2596
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:13,000
next few years right
 

2597
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,430
next few years right
um we need to have kind of all of those

2598
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:16,440
um we need to have kind of all of those
 

2599
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,950
um we need to have kind of all of those
but we what's actually really key is we

2600
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
but we what's actually really key is we
 

2601
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,430
but we what's actually really key is we
don't have to have all the different

2602
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:20,440
don't have to have all the different
 

2603
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,750
don't have to have all the different
sizes it that tends to not matter so

2604
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:22,760
sizes it that tends to not matter so
 

2605
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,750
sizes it that tends to not matter so
much what matters is the lowend versus

2606
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:25,760
much what matters is the lowend versus
 

2607
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,069
much what matters is the lowend versus
the highend are going to have very

2608
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:27,079
the highend are going to have very
 

2609
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:29,030
the highend are going to have very
different capabilities and have

2610
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
different capabilities and have
 

2611
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,150
different capabilities and have
different performance capabilities but

2612
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:31,160
different performance capabilities but
 

2613
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,910
different performance capabilities but
the 42 in versus the 65 in probably

2614
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:34,920
the 42 in versus the 65 in probably
 

2615
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,230
the 42 in versus the 65 in probably
going to be about the same and so we've

2616
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:37,240
going to be about the same and so we've
 

2617
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,030
going to be about the same and so we've
optimized our Fleet to be able to carry

2618
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:40,040
optimized our Fleet to be able to carry
 

2619
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,589
optimized our Fleet to be able to carry
55 inch televisions because most

2620
00:54:42,589 --> 00:54:42,599
55 inch televisions because most
 

2621
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,630
55 inch televisions because most
manufacturers have that size it's pretty

2622
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,640
manufacturers have that size it's pretty
 

2623
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,870
manufacturers have that size it's pretty
popular

00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:20,799
problem yeah because I imagine most
 

2651
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,750
problem yeah because I imagine most
people only change their television once

2652
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:22,760
people only change their television once
 

2653
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,470
people only change their television once
a decade so you've got to support the

2654
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:24,480
a decade so you've got to support the
 

2655
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,789
a decade so you've got to support the
old stuff that's right so so we have I

2656
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:27,799
old stuff that's right so so we have I
 

2657
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:31,430
old stuff that's right so so we have I
think going back like uh it's like six

2658
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
think going back like uh it's like six
 

2659
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,910
think going back like uh it's like six
or seven model years uh for most devices

2660
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:34,920
or seven model years uh for most devices
 

2661
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,349
or seven model years uh for most devices
and you know our inventory tends to be

2662
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:37,359
and you know our inventory tends to be
 

2663
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,510
and you know our inventory tends to be
smaller around the older stuff and you

2664
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:39,520
smaller around the older stuff and you
 

2665
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,670
smaller around the older stuff and you
know more volume around the the newer

2666
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:41,680
know more volume around the the newer
 

2667
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,029
know more volume around the the newer
types of devices um but then you we have

2668
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:45,039
types of devices um but then you we have
 

2669
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,190
types of devices um but then you we have
these uh shelves of of set top boxes

2670
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:48,200
these uh shelves of of set top boxes
 

2671
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,470
these uh shelves of of set top boxes
that we keep talking about where those

2672
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:50,480
that we keep talking about where those
 

2673
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,150
that we keep talking about where those
are really easy because they're small

2674
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
are really easy because they're small
 

2675
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,549
are really easy because they're small
and uh you know in a small volume you

2676
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:54,559
and uh you know in a small volume you
 

2677
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,270
and uh you know in a small volume you
can have a lot of them yeah um but it's

2678
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:57,280
can have a lot of them yeah um but it's
 

2679
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,990
can have a lot of them yeah um but it's
the the televisions that that pose our

2680
00:55:58,990 --> 00:55:59,000
the the televisions that that pose our
 

2681
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,670
the the televisions that that pose our
biggest challenge okay

2682
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:01,680
biggest challenge okay
 

2683
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,109
biggest challenge okay
so I'm imagining that you've gone

2684
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:04,119
so I'm imagining that you've gone
 

2685
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:06,589
so I'm imagining that you've gone
through this Warehouse of hundreds of

2686
00:56:06,589 --> 00:56:06,599
through this Warehouse of hundreds of
 

2687
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:08,990
through this Warehouse of hundreds of
sep toop boxes and televisions and

2688
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:09,000
sep toop boxes and televisions and
 

2689
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,230
sep toop boxes and televisions and
you've tagged them with metadata like

2690
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:11,240
you've tagged them with metadata like
 

2691
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,510
you've tagged them with metadata like
I'm an LG device I'm 55 in wide I come

2692
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:14,520
I'm an LG device I'm 55 in wide I come
 

2693
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,390
I'm an LG device I'm 55 in wide I come
from this year and I'm running this

2694
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:16,400
from this year and I'm running this
 

2695
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,990
from this year and I'm running this
operating system right that's right and

2696
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:19,000
operating system right that's right and
 

2697
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,109
operating system right that's right and
then I as an app developer say I want to

2698
00:56:22,109 --> 00:56:22,119
then I as an app developer say I want to
 

2699
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:25,670
then I as an app developer say I want to
test on one of each of the major brands

2700
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:25,680
test on one of each of the major brands
 

2701
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,710
test on one of each of the major brands
now you have have a classic scheduling

2702
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:28,720
now you have have a classic scheduling
 

2703
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,069
now you have have a classic scheduling
and queuing

2704
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:30,079
and queuing
 

2705
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,950
and queuing
problem right you've got to ship that

2706
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
problem right you've got to ship that
 

2707
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,950
problem right you've got to ship that
test to the available TVs that match

2708
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:35,960
test to the available TVs that match
 

2709
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,230
test to the available TVs that match
those criteria tell me about that

2710
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:39,240
those criteria tell me about that
 

2711
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,470
those criteria tell me about that
sure um so we have we called our demand

2712
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:43,480
sure um so we have we called our demand
 

2713
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,349
sure um so we have we called our demand
system uh and it's it it's a very boring

2714
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:47,359
system uh and it's it it's a very boring
 

2715
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,870
system uh and it's it it's a very boring
name but it takes demand for particular

2716
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:49,880
name but it takes demand for particular
 

2717
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,710
name but it takes demand for particular
devices and it matches a user uh based

2718
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
devices and it matches a user uh based
 

2719
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,470
devices and it matches a user uh based
on a priority cue of um you know do I

2720
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
on a priority cue of um you know do I
 

2721
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,270
on a priority cue of um you know do I
have a license so we we charge uh for

2722
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,280
have a license so we we charge uh for
 

2723
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,589
have a license so we we charge uh for
our product based on concurrent access

2724
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:01,599
our product based on concurrent access
 

2725
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,309
our product based on concurrent access
to televisions so depending on the

2726
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:05,319
to televisions so depending on the
 

2727
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:09,950
to televisions so depending on the
number of licenses that you have um we

2728
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:09,960
number of licenses that you have um we
 

2729
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,950
number of licenses that you have um we
will allow you to to connect to that

2730
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:11,960
will allow you to to connect to that
 

2731
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,230
will allow you to to connect to that
many televisions at once so if you have

2732
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,240
many televisions at once so if you have
 

2733
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,349
many televisions at once so if you have
three licenses then you can run a test

2734
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:16,359
three licenses then you can run a test
 

2735
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:18,470
three licenses then you can run a test
and at the same time we could run it on

2736
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:18,480
and at the same time we could run it on
 

2737
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,430
and at the same time we could run it on
three different devices um but you are

2738
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:20,440
three different devices um but you are
 

2739
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,910
three different devices um but you are
also competing with your teammates who

2740
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:22,920
also competing with your teammates who
 

2741
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,829
also competing with your teammates who
uh you know might not like that yeah so

2742
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:25,839
uh you know might not like that yeah so
 

2743
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:29,670
uh you know might not like that yeah so
we will um each each one of our clients

2744
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:29,680
we will um each each one of our clients
 

2745
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,710
we will um each each one of our clients
um sits on a different queue and so if

2746
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:31,720
um sits on a different queue and so if
 

2747
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,190
um sits on a different queue and so if
you uh ceue up uh I know 100 different

2748
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:35,200
you uh ceue up uh I know 100 different
 

2749
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,510
you uh ceue up uh I know 100 different
tests we will try to run all those 100

2750
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,520
tests we will try to run all those 100
 

2751
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,630
tests we will try to run all those 100
tests for you there is a Max time for

2752
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:39,640
tests for you there is a Max time for
 

2753
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,230
tests for you there is a Max time for
how long we'll let something sit in the

2754
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:41,240
how long we'll let something sit in the
 

2755
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,710
how long we'll let something sit in the
queue uh but you can schedule up all

2756
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:43,720
queue uh but you can schedule up all
 

2757
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,670
queue uh but you can schedule up all
this different demand and we will serve

2758
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:45,680
this different demand and we will serve
 

2759
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,029
this different demand and we will serve
it to you based on the number of

2760
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:47,039
it to you based on the number of
 

2761
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:49,710
it to you based on the number of
concurrent licenses but we will

2762
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:49,720
concurrent licenses but we will
 

2763
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,910
concurrent licenses but we will
prioritize uh those requests uh globally

2764
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:54,920
prioritize uh those requests uh globally
 

2765
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,430
prioritize uh those requests uh globally
uh across all the different

2766
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:56,440
uh across all the different
 

2767
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,069
uh across all the different
organizations who might be using our

2768
00:57:58,069 --> 00:57:58,079
organizations who might be using our
 

2769
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,510
organizations who might be using our
devices uh in sort of a round robin

2770
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:00,520
devices uh in sort of a round robin
 

2771
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,230
devices uh in sort of a round robin
fashion so uh what this does is it it

2772
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:03,240
fashion so uh what this does is it it
 

2773
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,430
fashion so uh what this does is it it
minimizes the amount of contention

2774
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,440
minimizes the amount of contention
 

2775
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,309
minimizes the amount of contention
between uh you know different

2776
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:07,319
between uh you know different
 

2777
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:09,589
between uh you know different
organizations who might be competing for

2778
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:09,599
organizations who might be competing for
 

2779
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,789
organizations who might be competing for
the same devices um and we'll we'll

2780
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:12,799
the same devices um and we'll we'll
 

2781
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,069
the same devices um and we'll we'll
prioritize based on time but if you

2782
00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:15,079
prioritize based on time but if you
 

2783
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:18,990
prioritize based on time but if you
haven't had uh a request recently and

2784
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:19,000
haven't had uh a request recently and
 

2785
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,309
haven't had uh a request recently and
someone is uh putting in a lot of volume

2786
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:21,319
someone is uh putting in a lot of volume
 

2787
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:23,910
someone is uh putting in a lot of volume
that will over time uh start to Decay a

2788
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:23,920
that will over time uh start to Decay a
 

2789
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,910
that will over time uh start to Decay a
little bit and get prioritized a little

2790
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:25,920
little bit and get prioritized a little
 

2791
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,589
little bit and get prioritized a little
bit lower than the person who's just

2792
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:27,599
bit lower than the person who's just
 

2793
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,190
bit lower than the person who's just
like hey I'm here to test today and you

2794
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:30,200
like hey I'm here to test today and you
 

2795
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,950
like hey I'm here to test today and you
know I'm not sending so much volume

2796
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:31,960
know I'm not sending so much volume
 

2797
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,390
know I'm not sending so much volume
through our

2798
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:33,400
through our
 

2799
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,630
through our
system so so this is optimizing for

2800
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:36,640
system so so this is optimizing for
 

2801
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,069
system so so this is optimizing for
throughput there that's right individual

2802
00:58:39,069 --> 00:58:39,079
throughput there that's right individual
 

2803
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:41,750
throughput there that's right individual
yeah okay that's right uh so we want our

2804
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:41,760
yeah okay that's right uh so we want our
 

2805
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,910
yeah okay that's right uh so we want our
system to be utilized and we want it to

2806
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:43,920
system to be utilized and we want it to
 

2807
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,270
system to be utilized and we want it to
be um you know as high we want to be

2808
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
be um you know as high we want to be
 

2809
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,670
be um you know as high we want to be
able to use our capacity to uh its full

2810
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:49,680
able to use our capacity to uh its full
 

2811
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,589
able to use our capacity to uh its full
extent as much as possible yeah um and

2812
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:52,599
extent as much as possible yeah um and
 

2813
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:56,630
extent as much as possible yeah um and
so to order to do this we keep um

2814
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:56,640
so to order to do this we keep um
 

2815
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,990
so to order to do this we keep um
I guess you can kind of think of it as

2816
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
I guess you can kind of think of it as
 

2817
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,829
I guess you can kind of think of it as
like a distributed database but we keep

2818
00:58:59,829 --> 00:58:59,839
like a distributed database but we keep
 

2819
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,349
like a distributed database but we keep
an inmemory uh database that uses crdts

2820
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
an inmemory uh database that uses crdts
 

2821
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,510
an inmemory uh database that uses crdts
to track um the current state of each

2822
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:05,520
to track um the current state of each
 

2823
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,510
to track um the current state of each
device in our

2824
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:07,520
device in our
 

2825
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,710
device in our
Fleet okay that's interesting I wouldn't

2826
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:10,720
Fleet okay that's interesting I wouldn't
 

2827
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,270
Fleet okay that's interesting I wouldn't
have thought crdt is come into this tell

2828
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:13,280
have thought crdt is come into this tell
 

2829
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,829
have thought crdt is come into this tell
me tell me more tell me more okay so our

2830
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:15,839
me tell me more tell me more okay so our
 

2831
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,470
me tell me more tell me more okay so our
web platform needs to be able to serve

2832
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
web platform needs to be able to serve
 

2833
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,710
web platform needs to be able to serve
uh many different geographic regions

2834
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:20,720
uh many different geographic regions
 

2835
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,630
uh many different geographic regions
because we have uh customers who are in

2836
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:22,640
because we have uh customers who are in
 

2837
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,990
because we have uh customers who are in
the US we also have customers who are in

2838
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:25,000
the US we also have customers who are in
 

2839
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,109
the US we also have customers who are in
Europe and the UK we have customers who

2840
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
Europe and the UK we have customers who
 

2841
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,150
Europe and the UK we have customers who
are uh working in Asia and you know

2842
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:30,160
are uh working in Asia and you know
 

2843
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,029
are uh working in Asia and you know
places like India you know Tokyo things

2844
00:59:33,029 --> 00:59:33,039
places like India you know Tokyo things
 

2845
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,190
places like India you know Tokyo things
like that so our web platform uh you

2846
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:36,200
like that so our web platform uh you
 

2847
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,670
like that so our web platform uh you
know is running different uh Edge

2848
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:38,680
know is running different uh Edge
 

2849
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,029
know is running different uh Edge
compute all over the place uh to be able

2850
00:59:41,029 --> 00:59:41,039
compute all over the place uh to be able
 

2851
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,829
compute all over the place uh to be able
to to have a nice experience for those

2852
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:42,839
to to have a nice experience for those
 

2853
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:44,230
to to have a nice experience for those
customers because it's a very

2854
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:44,240
customers because it's a very
 

2855
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,589
customers because it's a very
interactive uh platform that we offer um

2856
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:47,599
interactive uh platform that we offer um
 

2857
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,750
interactive uh platform that we offer um
the problem here is that each individual

2858
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:50,760
the problem here is that each individual
 

2859
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,390
the problem here is that each individual
device can only be used uh you know by a

2860
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:54,400
device can only be used uh you know by a
 

2861
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,549
device can only be used uh you know by a
single user at a time yeah yeah yeah um

2862
00:59:57,549 --> 00:59:57,559
single user at a time yeah yeah yeah um
 

2863
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,549
single user at a time yeah yeah yeah um
so um in that sense each of one of our

2864
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:00,559
so um in that sense each of one of our
 

2865
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,470
so um in that sense each of one of our
devices is its own source of Truth for

2866
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:03,480
devices is its own source of Truth for
 

2867
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,630
devices is its own source of Truth for
uh am I available or am I

2868
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:05,640
uh am I available or am I
 

2869
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,829
uh am I available or am I
not um however sending a request to

2870
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
not um however sending a request to
 

2871
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,349
not um however sending a request to
every single device and being like hey

2872
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:11,359
every single device and being like hey
 

2873
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,390
every single device and being like hey
are you available um to take take on a

2874
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
are you available um to take take on a
 

2875
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,589
are you available um to take take on a
new session is you know not very

2876
01:00:16,589 --> 01:00:16,599
new session is you know not very
 

2877
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:19,390
new session is you know not very
efficient um and also those devices I

2878
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:19,400
efficient um and also those devices I
 

2879
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,750
efficient um and also those devices I
mentioned they you know connect up to

2880

server sitting in uh New Jersey uh so
 

2897
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,630
server sitting in uh New Jersey uh so
our device actually might be connected

2898
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:42,640
our device actually might be connected
 

2899
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,829
our device actually might be connected
up to that uh device in New Jersey now

2900
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:46,839
up to that uh device in New Jersey now
 

2901
01:00:46,839 --> 01:00:49,430
up to that uh device in New Jersey now
someone some other user in San Francisco

2902
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,440
someone some other user in San Francisco
 

2903
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,829
someone some other user in San Francisco
might have just use that and now it

2904
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:50,839
might have just use that and now it
 

2905
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:52,670
might have just use that and now it
becomes available how do you know about

2906
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:52,680
becomes available how do you know about
 

2907
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,109
becomes available how do you know about
it uh this is where the crdt comes into

2908
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,119
it uh this is where the crdt comes into
 

2909
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,190
it uh this is where the crdt comes into
play so the crd is uh keeping track of

2910
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:58,200
play so the crd is uh keeping track of
 

2911
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,190
play so the crd is uh keeping track of
the current state of each television is

2912
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:00,200
the current state of each television is
 

2913
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,390
the current state of each television is
it available is it online is it in use

2914
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:03,400
it available is it online is it in use
 

2915
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,150
it available is it online is it in use
is it healthy um is it available for

2916
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:06,160
is it healthy um is it available for
 

2917
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,789
is it healthy um is it available for
connection um and we basically use that

2918
01:01:08,789 --> 01:01:08,799
connection um and we basically use that
 

2919
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,710
connection um and we basically use that
our our demand system is querying that

2920
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:11,720
our our demand system is querying that
 

2921
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,190
our our demand system is querying that
thing as kind of like the first uh check

2922
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:14,200
thing as kind of like the first uh check
 

2923
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,829
thing as kind of like the first uh check
for uh can I serve this this user

2924
01:01:16,829 --> 01:01:16,839
for uh can I serve this this user
 

2925
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,630
for uh can I serve this this user
request right now or do I need to keep

request right now or do I need to keep
 

2927
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,470
request right now or do I need to keep
them waiting and well we'll let them

2928
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
them waiting and well we'll let them
 

2929
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,789
them waiting and well we'll let them
know that you know there's nothing

2930
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:21,799
know that you know there's nothing
 

2931
01:01:21,799 --> 01:01:23,309
know that you know there's nothing
available and that we expect something

2932
01:01:23,309 --> 01:01:23,319
available and that we expect something
 

2933
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:25,069
available and that we expect something
to come online soon or that their

2934
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:25,079
to come online soon or that their
 

2935
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,270
to come online soon or that their
teammate is currently using it and all

2936
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:27,280
teammate is currently using it and all
 

2937
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,309
teammate is currently using it and all
this information is tracked by the crdt

2938
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
this information is tracked by the crdt
 

2939
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,829
this information is tracked by the crdt
right um but when it comes time to okay

2940
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:32,839
right um but when it comes time to okay
 

2941
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:34,309
right um but when it comes time to okay
we now think that this device is

2942
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:34,319
we now think that this device is
 

2943
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,710
we now think that this device is
available uh We've selected you to pair

2944
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:36,720
available uh We've selected you to pair
 

2945
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,870
available uh We've selected you to pair
with it will then initiate a session the

2946
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:39,880
with it will then initiate a session the
 

2947
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,510
with it will then initiate a session the
way that this works is that even if

2948
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
way that this works is that even if
 

2949
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,349
way that this works is that even if
you're sitting in London but the device

2950
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:43,359
you're sitting in London but the device
 

2951
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,190
you're sitting in London but the device
is in New Jersey uh through our Pub

2952
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:46,200
is in New Jersey uh through our Pub
 

2953
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,750
is in New Jersey uh through our Pub
subsystem it will send the uh request

2954
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
subsystem it will send the uh request
 

2955
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,710
subsystem it will send the uh request
for the session down to that device and

2956
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720
for the session down to that device and
 

2957
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,309
for the session down to that device and
now because that device is a source of

2958
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:54,319
now because that device is a source of
 

2959
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,349
now because that device is a source of
Truth it will either accept it and by

2960
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:56,359
Truth it will either accept it and by
 

2961
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:58,549
Truth it will either accept it and by
sending a message back and saying let's

2962
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559
sending a message back and saying let's
 

2963
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,150
sending a message back and saying let's
initiate a web RTC connection uh or

2964
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:01,160
initiate a web RTC connection uh or
 

2965
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,670
initiate a web RTC connection uh or
we'll direct it and say hey I'm actually

2966
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:03,680
we'll direct it and say hey I'm actually
 

2967
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,390
we'll direct it and say hey I'm actually
unhealthy or you know it reported my

2968
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:07,400
unhealthy or you know it reported my
 

2969
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,430
unhealthy or you know it reported my
session as available and I'm actually

2970
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:09,440
session as available and I'm actually
 

2971
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,190
session as available and I'm actually
unavailable due to some bug um but

2972
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:12,200
unavailable due to some bug um but
 

2973
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,549
unavailable due to some bug um but
that's that ends up being the source of

2974
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:13,559
that's that ends up being the source of
 

2975
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:15,430
that's that ends up being the source of
Truth the crdt is the thing that keeps

2976
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
Truth the crdt is the thing that keeps
 

2977
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,069
Truth the crdt is the thing that keeps
it fast and is kind of like this like in

2978
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:18,079
it fast and is kind of like this like in
 

2979
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,630
it fast and is kind of like this like in
memory database for um knowing who's

2980
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:21,640
memory database for um knowing who's
 

2981
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,670
memory database for um knowing who's
available in

2982
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:22,680
available in
 

2983
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,910
available in
online okay so it's kind of like um

2984
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:25,920
online okay so it's kind of like um
 

2985
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,470
online okay so it's kind of like um
you're connecting to a central server to

2986
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
you're connecting to a central server to
 

2987
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,349
you're connecting to a central server to
find out which peer-to-peer connections

2988
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
find out which peer-to-peer connections
 

2989
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,190
find out which peer-to-peer connections
you're allowed to make that's right of

2990
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:34,200
you're allowed to make that's right of
 

2991
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,190
you're allowed to make that's right of
yeah yeah yeah sort of yeah uh and the

2992
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,200
yeah yeah yeah sort of yeah uh and the
 

2993
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,029
yeah yeah yeah sort of yeah uh and the
demand server is connecting to the local

2994
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:42,039
demand server is connecting to the local
 

2995
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:44,910
demand server is connecting to the local
database which replicates the actual

2996
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:44,920
database which replicates the actual
 

2997
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,029
database which replicates the actual
source of Truth which is the individual

2998
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,039
source of Truth which is the individual
 

2999
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,470
source of Truth which is the individual
container that's right I think I have

3000
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:49,480
container that's right I think I have
 

3001
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,029
container that's right I think I have
that in my head okay that's right and

3002
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:52,039
that in my head okay that's right and
 

3003
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:53,789
that in my head okay that's right and
and when we say server we're talking

3004
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:53,799
and when we say server we're talking
 

3005
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:56,430
and when we say server we're talking
about you know we just have our

3006
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:56,440
about you know we just have our
 

3007
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,309
about you know we just have our
um Elixir uh apps running the cloud

3008
01:02:59,309 --> 01:02:59,319
um Elixir uh apps running the cloud
 

3009
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:00,829
um Elixir uh apps running the cloud
there's not like all these different

3010
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:00,839
there's not like all these different
 

3011
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:02,630
there's not like all these different
microservices that are responsible for

3012
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:02,640
microservices that are responsible for
 

3013
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,870
microservices that are responsible for
one thing it's just one web platform

3014
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
one thing it's just one web platform
 

3015
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,109
one thing it's just one web platform
that has all these different

3016
01:03:06,109 --> 01:03:06,119
that has all these different
 

3017
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,630
that has all these different
responsibilities managed by gen servers

3018
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640
responsibilities managed by gen servers
 

3019
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,150
responsibilities managed by gen servers
that use things like hash rings to

3020
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:11,160
that use things like hash rings to
 

3021
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,150
that use things like hash rings to
distribute the the load uh across all

3022
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,160
distribute the the load uh across all
 

3023
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,349
distribute the the load uh across all
the different servers globally right I

3024
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:16,359
the different servers globally right I
 

3025
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,309
the different servers globally right I
was going to say is the is this does

3026
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
was going to say is the is this does
 

3027
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,150
was going to say is the is this does
this actually end up just being a bunch

3028
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
this actually end up just being a bunch
 

3029
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,990
this actually end up just being a bunch
of erlang actors and is that the reason

3030
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:23,000
of erlang actors and is that the reason
 

3031
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,069
of erlang actors and is that the reason
for choosing

3032
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:24,079
for choosing
 

3033
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,990
for choosing
llang well there's many different

3034
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:26,000
llang well there's many different
 

3035
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,029
llang well there's many different
reasons for choosing

3036
01:03:29,029 --> 01:03:29,039

 

3037
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,549

erlang so okay there's a lot of problems

3038
01:03:33,549 --> 01:03:33,559
erlang so okay there's a lot of problems
 

3039
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,789
erlang so okay there's a lot of problems
that

3040
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
that
 

3041
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,029
that
um that we're trying to solve that I

3042
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:37,039
um that we're trying to solve that I
 

3043
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,510
um that we're trying to solve that I
think erlang and elixir and and the beam

3044
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,520
think erlang and elixir and and the beam
 

3045
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,670
think erlang and elixir and and the beam
VM the bur beam virtual machine are very

3046
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:41,680
VM the bur beam virtual machine are very
 

3047
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,309
VM the bur beam virtual machine are very
good at so the beam virtual machine is

3048
01:03:44,309 --> 01:03:44,319
good at so the beam virtual machine is
 

3049
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:47,349
good at so the beam virtual machine is
really good at fault tolerance you know

3050
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:47,359
really good at fault tolerance you know
 

3051
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,109
really good at fault tolerance you know
let it crash we'll restart it for you if

3052
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:49,119
let it crash we'll restart it for you if
 

3053
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,990
let it crash we'll restart it for you if
it goes down yeah um it's good at uh low

3054
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:53,000
it goes down yeah um it's good at uh low
 

3055
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,950
it goes down yeah um it's good at uh low
latency and and you know decently High

3056
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:55,960
latency and and you know decently High
 

3057
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,789
latency and and you know decently High
throughput systems um and it's really

3058
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799
throughput systems um and it's really
 

3059
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,630
throughput systems um and it's really
good with um Building Systems that are

3060
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:01,640
good with um Building Systems that are
 

3061
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,990
good with um Building Systems that are
relatively simple due to a mutable data

3062
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:04,000
relatively simple due to a mutable data
 

3063
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,549
relatively simple due to a mutable data
and functional

3064
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:05,559
and functional
 

3065
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:07,630
and functional
programming um and then there's the

3066
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:07,640
programming um and then there's the
 

3067
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,069
programming um and then there's the
whole distribution aspect which is being

3068
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079
whole distribution aspect which is being
 

3069
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,309
whole distribution aspect which is being
able to connect nodes that are globally

3070
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:12,319
able to connect nodes that are globally
 

3071
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,230
able to connect nodes that are globally
distributed and have them communicate to

3072
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:14,240
distributed and have them communicate to
 

3073
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,430
distributed and have them communicate to
each other and send messages back and

3074
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:16,440
each other and send messages back and
 

3075
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,990
each other and send messages back and
forth and uh subscribe to different

3076
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:19,000
forth and uh subscribe to different
 

3077
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,190
forth and uh subscribe to different
topics of interest and not really have

3078
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,200
topics of interest and not really have
 

3079
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,870
topics of interest and not really have
to worry about the orchestration of that

3080
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:23,880
to worry about the orchestration of that
 

3081
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,230
to worry about the orchestration of that
all yeah and what's really bread and

3082
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:26,240
all yeah and what's really bread and
 

3083
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,630
all yeah and what's really bread and
butter programming inl right it's not a

3084
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,640
butter programming inl right it's not a
 

3085
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,109
butter programming inl right it's not a
weird thing yeah that's right and so

3086
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:31,119
weird thing yeah that's right and so
 

3087
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,829
weird thing yeah that's right and so
what's what's so interesting I think

3088
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:32,839
what's what's so interesting I think
 

3089
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:35,029
what's what's so interesting I think
about Elixir uh for this particular

3090
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:35,039
about Elixir uh for this particular
 

3091
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,910
about Elixir uh for this particular
solution is in any other programming

3092
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:37,920
solution is in any other programming
 

3093
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,470
solution is in any other programming
language you'll probably have to have a

3094
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:40,480
language you'll probably have to have a
 

3095
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,990
language you'll probably have to have a
constellation of other services that are

3096
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:43,000
constellation of other services that are
 

3097
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,829
constellation of other services that are
just for doing the communication um like

3098
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:45,839
just for doing the communication um like
 

3099
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,990
just for doing the communication um like
if we take websockets for an example all

3100
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
if we take websockets for an example all
 

3101
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,510
if we take websockets for an example all
of our different um devices TVs and sets

3102
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,520
of our different um devices TVs and sets
 

3103
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,470
of our different um devices TVs and sets
up boxes the way that they communicate

3104
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:53,480
up boxes the way that they communicate
 

3105
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,950
up boxes the way that they communicate
up to our web platform is that they make

3106
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960
up to our web platform is that they make
 

3107
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,910
up to our web platform is that they make
a websocket connection for most other

3108
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
a websocket connection for most other
 

3109
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,190
a websocket connection for most other
systems you'll have to have a separate

3110
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:00,200
systems you'll have to have a separate
 

3111
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,230
systems you'll have to have a separate
service just for holding on to those

3112
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,240

your other systems we could just do that

3120
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:12,079
your other systems we could just do that
 

3121
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,589
your other systems we could just do that
in Elixir and llang and that that's

3122
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
in Elixir and llang and that that's
 

3123
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,990
in Elixir and llang and that that's
really easy but the part the thing that

3124
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,000
really easy but the part the thing that

01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:40,440
conversation um I then dipped my toes
 

3237
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,990
conversation um I then dipped my toes
into JavaScript and I mentioned that

3238
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,000
into JavaScript and I mentioned that
 

3239

but I was kind of like itching for

3242
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:47,160
but I was kind of like itching for
 

3243
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,349
but I was kind of like itching for
something else and I got into this uh

3244
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:50,359
something else and I got into this uh
 

3245
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:52,230
something else and I got into this uh
functional programming kick with Elm and

3246
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:52,240
functional programming kick with Elm and
 

3247
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,029
functional programming kick with Elm and
I'm like this is so cool my my manager

3248
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:55,039
I'm like this is so cool my my manager
 

3249
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,029
I'm like this is so cool my my manager
was like you like Elm you'd probably

3250
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:57,039
was like you like Elm you'd probably
 

3251
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,069
was like you like Elm you'd probably
really like this uh this thing that this

3252
01:07:59,069 --> 01:07:59,079
really like this uh this thing that this
 

3253
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,230
really like this uh this thing that this
guy in the Ruby Community uh has been

3254
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:01,240
guy in the Ruby Community uh has been
 

3255
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,269
guy in the Ruby Community uh has been
talking about called

3256
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:03,279
talking about called
 

3257
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:05,470
talking about called
Elixir and so I was like oh let me try

3258
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:05,480
Elixir and so I was like oh let me try
 

3259
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,029
Elixir and so I was like oh let me try
that and what I found with Elixir was

3260
01:08:09,029 --> 01:08:09,039
that and what I found with Elixir was
 

3261
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,870
that and what I found with Elixir was
this idea of pattern matching which is

3262
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:10,880
this idea of pattern matching which is
 

3263
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,390
this idea of pattern matching which is
something i' never seen in any other

3264
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:12,400
something i' never seen in any other
 

3265
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,829
something i' never seen in any other
programming language um and that was the

3266
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:14,839
programming language um and that was the
 

3267
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:17,510
programming language um and that was the

I think is rescript I don't they might
 

3423
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,430
I think is rescript I don't they might
be related I my o camel is

01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:39,440
be related I my o camel is
 

3425
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,990
be related I my o camel is
um I need to dabble in O camel there

3426
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
um I need to dabble in O camel there
 

3427
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,229
um I need to dabble in O camel there
there's some cool things happening in

3428
01:11:43,229 --> 01:11:43,239
there's some cool things happening in
 

3429
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:46,070
there's some cool things happening in
that community over there me too me too

3430
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
that community over there me too me too
 

3431
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,870
that community over there me too me too
yeah um I need to spend more time with o

3432
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:47,880
yeah um I need to spend more time with o
 

3433
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,750
yeah um I need to spend more time with o
camel there are only so many hours in

3434
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:49,760
camel there are only so many hours in
 

3435
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,310
camel there are only so many hours in
the day that leads me to ask perhaps to

3436
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
the day that leads me to ask perhaps to
 

3437
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,430
the day that leads me to ask perhaps to
to wrap up hours in the day where are

3438
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,440
to wrap up hours in the day where are
 

3439
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,709
to wrap up hours in the day where are
you where are you spending yours in the

3440
01:11:57,709 --> 01:11:57,719
you where are you spending yours in the
 

3441
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:00,990
you where are you spending yours in the
coming months what's left to solve in

3442
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:01,000
coming months what's left to solve in
 

3443
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,070
coming months what's left to solve in
this

3444
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
this
 

3445
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,870
this
space so we're uh we've been in business

3446
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:05,880
space so we're uh we've been in business
 

3447
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,070
space so we're uh we've been in business
now for about a year and a half and

3448
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:08,080
now for about a year and a half and
 

3449
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,229
now for about a year and a half and
we're we've been working with customers

3450
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:10,239
we're we've been working with customers
 

3451
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,030
we're we've been working with customers
and clients uh but we're very much in

3452
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:12,040
and clients uh but we're very much in
 

3453
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,350
and clients uh but we're very much in
our go to market phase and so a lot of

3454
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:14,360
our go to market phase and so a lot of
 

3455
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:18,510
our go to market phase and so a lot of
this is taking these fundamental uh

3456
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:18,520
this is taking these fundamental uh
 

3457
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,990
this is taking these fundamental uh
uh products and features and making them

3458
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:22,000
uh products and features and making them
 

3459
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,229
uh products and features and making them
very usable really dialing in the ux I

3460
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:24,239
very usable really dialing in the ux I
 

3461
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,390
very usable really dialing in the ux I
think we've spent most most of our time

3462
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:26,400
think we've spent most most of our time
 

3463
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,790
think we've spent most most of our time
making the system

3464
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:27,800
making the system
 

3465
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,430
making the system
reliable and you know the five different

3466
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:30,440
reliable and you know the five different
 

3467
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,870
reliable and you know the five different
ways of restarting our system is kind of

3468
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:32,880
ways of restarting our system is kind of
 

3469
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,149
ways of restarting our system is kind of
goes into it where we've had to dog food

3470
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:35,159
goes into it where we've had to dog food
 

3471
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:37,070
goes into it where we've had to dog food
our our platform and use it over and

3472
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:37,080
our our platform and use it over and
 

3473
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,110
our our platform and use it over and
over and over again and run into all

3474
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
over and over again and run into all
 

3475
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,149
over and over again and run into all
these stumbling blocks and it's only

3476
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:41,159
these stumbling blocks and it's only
 

3477
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:43,430
these stumbling blocks and it's only
until recently where we feel that our

3478
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
until recently where we feel that our
 

3479
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,629
until recently where we feel that our
platform is so reliable that it's it's

3480
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:45,639
platform is so reliable that it's it's
 

3481
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:47,870
platform is so reliable that it's it's
really useful for other people too um

3482
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:47,880
really useful for other people too um
 

3483
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,149
really useful for other people too um
and so what we're spending most of our

3484
01:12:49,149 --> 01:12:49,159
and so what we're spending most of our
 

3485
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:51,830
and so what we're spending most of our
time on is in JavaScript land and and

3486
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
time on is in JavaScript land and and
 

3487
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,669
time on is in JavaScript land and and
spelt and is in polishing these tools

3488
01:12:54,669 --> 01:12:54,679
spelt and is in polishing these tools
 

3489
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:57,430
spelt and is in polishing these tools
and uh building these features for

3490
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,440
and uh building these features for
 

3491
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,030
and uh building these features for
introspecting state and really being

3492
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:00,040
introspecting state and really being
 

3493
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,750
introspecting state and really being
able to visualize what's happening in

3494
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:01,760
able to visualize what's happening in
 

3495
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,270
able to visualize what's happening in
our system so that it's really easy to

3496
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:04,280
our system so that it's really easy to
 

3497
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,669
our system so that it's really easy to
go and diagnose a problem um and this is

3498
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:07,679
go and diagnose a problem um and this is
 

3499
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,750
go and diagnose a problem um and this is
kind of like the very top layer of our

3500
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:09,760
kind of like the very top layer of our
 

3501
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,229
kind of like the very top layer of our
system where all of that lowlevel stuff

3502
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,239
system where all of that lowlevel stuff
 

3503
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,590
system where all of that lowlevel stuff
underneath it uh is kind of abstracted

3504
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:14,600
underneath it uh is kind of abstracted
 

3505
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,870
underneath it uh is kind of abstracted
away from you and our product just seems

3506
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:16,880
away from you and our product just seems
 

3507
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,270
away from you and our product just seems
like you know so boring and you know

3508
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
like you know so boring and you know
 

3509
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,709
like you know so boring and you know
obvious that you'd be able to work with

3510
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:20,719
obvious that you'd be able to work with
 

3511
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,830
obvious that you'd be able to work with
a television but there's just all these

3512
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:22,840
a television but there's just all these
 

3513
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,709
a television but there's just all these
little bits and pieces and hard problems
