way well for me it's a um um it's a

uh expressiveness of the Lambda calculus
 

251
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:35,029
uh expressiveness of the Lambda calculus
right so one of the things that always

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
right so one of the things that always
 

253
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,309
right so one of the things that always
attracted me about functional

00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,469
attracted me about functional
programming um is that it's a place

where theory and practice come rather
 

259
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,270
where theory and practice come rather
close together um so you can build

260
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280

261
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,950
close together um so you can build
practical programming language that

machine um and both of them are

300
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
machine um and both of them are
 

301
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,270
machine um and both of them are
computationally complete that is to say

302
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
computationally complete that is to say
 

303
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,430
computationally complete that is to say
uh um if we want to say what can

304
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
uh um if we want to say what can
 

305
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,670
uh um if we want to say what can
computers do fundamentally we say well

306
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
computers do fundamentally we say well
 

307
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,309
computers do fundamentally we say well
that they're just touring machines if a

308
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:37,319
that they're just touring machines if a

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,749
that they're just touring machines if a

311
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,469
during machine can do it a computer can
do it and vice versa yeah um but you can

312
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:41,479
do it and vice versa yeah um but you can
 

313
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,830
do it and vice versa yeah um but you can
also say um they're just Lambda calculus

314
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
also say um they're just Lambda calculus
 

315
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,110
also say um they're just Lambda calculus
machines right if a computer do it a

316
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,120

317
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,270
machines right if a computer do it a
Lambda term can do it and in fact it was

318
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,280
Lambda term can do it and in fact it was
 

319
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,430
Lambda term can do it and in fact it was
entirely nonobvious but in fact it turns

320
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:50,440
entirely nonobvious but in fact it turns
 

321
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,749
entirely nonobvious but in fact it turns
out that touring machines and and Lambda

322
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:52,759
out that touring machines and and Lambda
 

323
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,510
out that touring machines and and Lambda
calculus are uh inter definable that is

324
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
calculus are uh inter definable that is
 

325
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,029
calculus are uh inter definable that is
you can write a touring machine which

326
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
you can write a touring machine which
 

327
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,309
you can write a touring machine which
will run any Lambda term and you can

328
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
will run any Lambda term and you can
 

329
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,550
will run any Lambda term and you can
write a Lambda term that'll run run a

330
00:06:59,550 --> 00:06:59,560
write a Lambda term that'll run run a
 

331
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,309
write a Lambda term that'll run run a
touring machine right they're equally

332
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:01,319
touring machine right they're equally
 

333
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,230
touring machine right they're equally
expressive good yeah um so now then it

334
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
expressive good yeah um so now then it
 

335
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,550
expressive good yeah um so now then it
didn't really happen like this but you

336
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,560
didn't really happen like this but you
 

337
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,909
didn't really happen like this but you
can imagine that all of imperative

338
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:06,919
can imagine that all of imperative
 

339
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,550
can imagine that all of imperative

341
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,390

right was it a touring machine it it has

342
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
right was it a touring machine it it has
 

343
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,909
right was it a touring machine it it has
this tape and it mutates um you know

344
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:12,919
this tape and it mutates um you know
 

345
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,430
this tape and it mutates um you know
mutates the tape it it reads and writes

346
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
mutates the tape it it reads and writes
 

347
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,749
mutates the tape it it reads and writes
things on the tape the tape is like the

348
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:16,759
things on the tape the tape is like the
 

349
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,390
things on the tape the tape is like the
store um it's fundamentally a mutation

350
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:19,400

351
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,869

00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:21,879
machine what is the Lambda calculus well
 

353
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,550

um at any moment you have a a term a

354
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
um at any moment you have a a term a
 

355
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,749
um at any moment you have a a term a
Lambda term and it simply um uh and you

356
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
Lambda term and it simply um uh and you
 

357
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,550
Lambda term and it simply um uh and you
rewrite it one step at a time just keep

358
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,560
rewrite it one step at a time just keep
 

359
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,189
rewrite it one step at a time just keep
rewriting and you get some answer and

360
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
rewriting and you get some answer and
 

361
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,589
rewriting and you get some answer and
this is a completely different model of

362
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:32,599
this is a completely different model of
 

363
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,230
this is a completely different model of
computation that's um and functional

364
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,240
computation that's um and functional
 

365
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,749
computation that's um and functional
programming is built on the that purely

00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
programming is built on the that purely
 

367
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,350

368
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360

imperative program is built on a more um

370
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:41,800
imperative program is built on a more um

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,469
imperative program is built on a more um
M mutation based touring machine style

372
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
M mutation based touring machine style
 

373
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,749
M mutation based touring machine style
thing so it's almost as if two entire

374
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:46,759
thing so it's almost as if two entire
 

375
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,990

approaches to programming have grown up

376
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,000
approaches to programming have grown up
 

377
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,589
approaches to programming have grown up
um built on different foundations but

378
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:50,599
um built on different foundations but
 

379
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,270
um built on different foundations but
that ultimately ultimately they're

380
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,280
that ultimately ultimately they're
 

381
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,230
that ultimately ultimately they're
equally expressive so for me um I've

382
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,240
equally expressive so for me um I've
 

383
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,670
equally expressive so for me um I've
always loved um the Lambda calculus as a

384
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:58,680
always loved um the Lambda calculus as a
 

385
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,350
always loved um the Lambda calculus as a
basis for computation and it turns out

386
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
basis for computation and it turns out
 

387
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,950
basis for computation and it turns out
that you can translate um well all sorts

388
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:03,960
that you can translate um well all sorts
 

389
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,550
that you can translate um well all sorts

of languages including hll into this
 

391
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,070
of languages including hll into this
very small core and moreover the thing

392
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
very small core and moreover the thing
 

393
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,790
very small core and moreover the thing
that I appeal to me particularly um is

394
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
that I appeal to me particularly um is
 

395
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,830
that I appeal to me particularly um is
that uh that's not just a theoretical

396
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:12,840
that uh that's not just a theoretical
 

397
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,270
that uh that's not just a theoretical
idea it's a practical idea you can

idea it's a practical idea you can
 

399
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,629
idea it's a practical idea you can
actually build a compiler um that

400
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
actually build a compiler um that
 

401
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,990
actually build a compiler um that
translates into this small core and

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,830
translates into this small core and
moreover um the the Lambda calculus you

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
moreover um the the Lambda calculus you
 

405
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,430
moreover um the the Lambda calculus you
know had a long history of development

00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:52,839
run it it will
 

481
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,310
run it it will
crash yeah right so if you don't have a

482
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,320
crash yeah right so if you don't have a
 

483
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,949
crash yeah right so if you don't have a
typed Intermediate Language what happens

484
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
typed Intermediate Language what happens
 

485
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,590
typed Intermediate Language what happens
is you have a bug in your compiler you

486
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:58,600
is you have a bug in your compiler you
 

487
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,150
is you have a bug in your compiler you
compile a program you try to run the

488
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
compile a program you try to run the
 

489
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,590
compile a program you try to run the
program and it crashes you think why

490
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:02,600
program and it crashes you think why
 

491
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,630
program and it crashes you think why
does it crash so you can know get GDB

492
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
does it crash so you can know get GDB
 

493
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,110
does it crash so you can know get GDB
out and work out why it's crashes then

494
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,120
out and work out why it's crashes then
 

495
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,590
out and work out why it's crashes then
say Oh the code generator is generating

496
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:08,600
say Oh the code generator is generating
 

497
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,030
say Oh the code generator is generating
the wrong code why is that oh because

498
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,040
the wrong code why is that oh because
 

499
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,069
the wrong code why is that oh because
the intermediate program are you know

500
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
the intermediate program are you know
 

501
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,910
the intermediate program are you know
some many levels of transformation back

502
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:14,920
some many levels of transformation back
 

503
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,509
some many levels of transformation back
ah the optimizer introduced the bug the

504
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:18,519
ah the optimizer introduced the bug the
 

505
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,069
ah the optimizer introduced the bug the
optimizer turned a type correct program

506
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:21,079
optimizer turned a type correct program
 

507
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,590
optimizer turned a type correct program
into a type incorrect program which

508
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:22,600
into a type incorrect program which
 

509
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,230
into a type incorrect program which
crashes now it's way better for the

510
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
crashes now it's way better for the
 

511
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,069
crashes now it's way better for the
compiler to say uhoh I find that I have

512
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:29,079
compiler to say uhoh I find that I have
 

513
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:30,550
compiler to say uhoh I find that I have
turned a type incorrect program into a

514
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
turned a type incorrect program into a
 

515
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,910
turned a type incorrect program into a
sorry type correct program into a type

516
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
sorry type correct program into a type
 

517
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,990
sorry type correct program into a type
incorrect program and report so that

518
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
incorrect program and report so that
 

519
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,550
incorrect program and report so that
that reports the error immediately it

520
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:35,560
that reports the error immediately it
 

521
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,550
that reports the error immediately it
happens rather than compiling it all the

522
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:37,560
happens rather than compiling it all the
 

523
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,150
happens rather than compiling it all the
way to machine code running the machine

524
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,160
way to machine code running the machine
 

525
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,990
way to machine code running the machine
code and then having to backtrack up to

526
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,000
code and then having to backtrack up to
 

527
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,269
code and then having to backtrack up to
find the bug in the compiler yeah yeah

528
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
find the bug in the compiler yeah yeah
 

529
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,590
find the bug in the compiler yeah yeah
okay that makes sense but there's

530
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
okay that makes sense but there's
 

531
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,509
okay that makes sense but there's
there's this thing with like having this

532
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
there's this thing with like having this
 

533
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,509
there's this thing with like having this
tightly defined core which actually if

534
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
tightly defined core which actually if
 

535
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,790
tightly defined core which actually if
I'm right is fairly small I mean it's

536
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm right is fairly small I mean it's
 

537
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,790
I'm right is fairly small I mean it's
implementable reasonably if you've got

538
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:53,800
implementable reasonably if you've got
 

539
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,030
implementable reasonably if you've got
the knowledge to do it yeah first of all

540
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
the knowledge to do it yeah first of all
 

541
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,269
the knowledge to do it yeah first of all
um I'm just thinking

542
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:00,279
um I'm just thinking
 

543
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,230
um I'm just thinking
a lot of people come to this idea as

544
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
a lot of people come to this idea as
 

545
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,590
a lot of people come to this idea as
being like

546
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
being like
 

547
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,310
being like
llvm in that there's this

548
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
llvm in that there's this
 

549
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,629
llvm in that there's this
lowlevel llvm is not as tightly defined

550
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:09,639
lowlevel llvm is not as tightly defined
 

551
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,190
lowlevel llvm is not as tightly defined
but I'm just trying to get a sense of

552
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
but I'm just trying to get a sense of
 

553
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,509
but I'm just trying to get a sense of
where something like ghc's core might

554
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
where something like ghc's core might
 

555
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,829
where something like ghc's core might
appeal to language implementers and

556
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
appeal to language implementers and
 

557
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,829
appeal to language implementers and
people interested in how languages are

558
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
people interested in how languages are
 

559
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,949
people interested in how languages are
implemented when they seem to already

560
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:23,959
implemented when they seem to already
 

561
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,990
implemented when they seem to already
have this popular thing called

562
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
have this popular thing called
 

563
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,590
have this popular thing called
llvm well by the time you get to llvm

564
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,600
llvm well by the time you get to llvm
 

565
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,629
llvm well by the time you get to llvm
you've already descended several layers

566
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:31,639
you've already descended several layers
 

567
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,910
you've already descended several layers
of abstraction right compilers typically

568
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
of abstraction right compilers typically
 

569
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,670
of abstraction right compilers typically
work at um various levels of abstraction

570
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:36,680
work at um various levels of abstraction
 

571
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,590
work at um various levels of abstraction
so if I've got a um you know hasore

572
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:38,600
so if I've got a um you know hasore
 

573
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,230
so if I've got a um you know hasore
program I might say to a programmer how

574
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
program I might say to a programmer how
 

575
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,670
program I might say to a programmer how
do if I'm trying to explain how it runs

576
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:42,680
do if I'm trying to explain how it runs
 

577
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,069
do if I'm trying to explain how it runs
I say well you've got this function call

578
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
I say well you've got this function call
 

579
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,629
I say well you've got this function call
you can replace the call by the body of

580
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:46,639
you can replace the call by the body of
 

581
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,069
you can replace the call by the body of
the function replacing the arguments of

582
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:49,079
the function replacing the arguments of
 

583
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,829
the function replacing the arguments of
the function with the actual arguments

584
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:50,839
the function with the actual arguments
 

585
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,269
the function with the actual arguments
that you passed in the call right now

586
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:52,279
that you passed in the call right now
 

587
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,829
that you passed in the call right now
you just keep doing that and that's how

588
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
you just keep doing that and that's how
 

589
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,230
you just keep doing that and that's how
the program executes of course that's

590
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,240
the program executes of course that's
 

591
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,829
the program executes of course that's
not really how the program executes um

592
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
not really how the program executes um
 

593
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,310
not really how the program executes um
but really the program does you know

594
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,320
but really the program does you know
 

595
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,150
but really the program does you know
machine transfers and pushes things on

machine transfers and pushes things on
 

597
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,870
machine transfers and pushes things on

stores things in the Heap and runs a
 

601
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,990
stores things in the Heap and runs a
garbage collector um so uh but but

602
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
garbage collector um so uh but but
 

603
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,550
garbage collector um so uh but but
nevertheless if you want to explain to a

604
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
nevertheless if you want to explain to a
 

605
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,069
nevertheless if you want to explain to a
programmer how it runs you might think

606
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
programmer how it runs you might think
 

607
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,829
programmer how it runs you might think
in this rewriting term rewriting way um

608
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:14,839
in this rewriting term rewriting way um
 

609
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,590
in this rewriting term rewriting way um
and indeed the optimizer Works in this

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
become essentially completely
 

639
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,750
become essentially completely
inaccessible by the time you get to the

640
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
inaccessible by the time you get to the
 

641
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,829
inaccessible by the time you get to the
low level right so and this is this is

642
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
low level right so and this is this is
 

643
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,629
low level right so and this is this is
not new right every compiler has this

644
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:53,639
not new right every compiler has this
 

645
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,710
not new right every compiler has this
idea of we do some Transformations and

646
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:55,720
idea of we do some Transformations and
 

647
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,870
idea of we do some Transformations and
optimizations using the high level code

648
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:57,880
optimizations using the high level code
 

649
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,550
optimizations using the high level code
and then we sort of move down to a low

650
00:12:59,550 --> 00:12:59,560
and then we sort of move down to a low
 

651
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,310
and then we sort of move down to a low
level closer to the machine um and that

652
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:03,320
level closer to the machine um and that
 

653
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,750
level closer to the machine um and that
at that point the high level

654
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:04,760
at that point the high level
 

655
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,430
at that point the high level
optimizations become essentially

656
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:06,440
optimizations become essentially
 

657
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,389
optimizations become essentially
inaccessible but new lower level

658
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
inaccessible but new lower level
 

659
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,350
inaccessible but new lower level
optimizations like which register shall

660
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:10,360
optimizations like which register shall
 

661
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,389
optimizations like which register shall
I put it in become accessible right they

662
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:13,399
I put it in become accessible right they
 

663
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,110
I put it in become accessible right they
were not not expressible in the high

664
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
were not not expressible in the high
 

665
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,870
were not not expressible in the high
level stuff so the lrvm stroke C minus

666
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:17,880
level stuff so the lrvm stroke C minus
 

667
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,590
level stuff so the lrvm stroke C minus
minus part is really in ghc's back end

668
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
minus part is really in ghc's back end
 

669
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,150
minus part is really in ghc's back end
right this the

670
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,160
right this the
 

671
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,230
right this the
intermediate um language this system a

672
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
intermediate um language this system a
 

673
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,790
intermediate um language this system a
flight language that I was describing

674
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:27,800
flight language that I was describing
 

675
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,030
flight language that I was describing
which GHC uses mostly that is the sort

676
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
which GHC uses mostly that is the sort
 

677
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,590
which GHC uses mostly that is the sort
of the F the middle of GHC the long

678
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
of the F the middle of GHC the long
 

679
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,790
of the F the middle of GHC the long
middle that does lots of functional

680
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:35,800
middle that does lots of functional
 

681
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,189
middle that does lots of functional
programming kind of optimizations does

682
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:37,199
programming kind of optimizations does
 

683
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,670
programming kind of optimizations does
that make sense they're very different

684
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:38,680
that make sense they're very different
 

685
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,310
that make sense they're very different
purposes is what I mean it's not the one

686
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
purposes is what I mean it's not the one
 

687
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,389
purposes is what I mean it's not the one
is better than the other it's just

688
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:41,399
is better than the other it's just
 

689
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,389
is better than the other it's just
they're different so we're almost

690
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:43,399
they're different so we're almost
 

691
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,269
they're different so we're almost
talking about a three layer lasagna of

692
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
talking about a three layer lasagna of
 

693
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,870
talking about a three layer lasagna of
programming yeah yeah you take hcll you

694
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:49,880
programming yeah yeah you take hcll you
 

695
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,590
programming yeah yeah you take hcll you
turn it into core you optimize then you

696
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
turn it into core you optimize then you
 

697
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,269
turn it into core you optimize then you
turn it into l c minus minus or lvm and

698
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:54,279
turn it into l c minus minus or lvm and
 

699
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,509
turn it into l c minus minus or lvm and
you optimize some more yeah right okay

700
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:56,519
you optimize some more yeah right okay
 

701
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,790
you optimize some more yeah right okay
so what makes that middle layer the core

702
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
so what makes that middle layer the core
 

703
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,430
so what makes that middle layer the core
or some kind of design sweet spot is it

704
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
or some kind of design sweet spot is it
 

705
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,550
or some kind of design sweet spot is it
that it's got um a solid theoretical

706
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:03,560
that it's got um a solid theoretical
 

707
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,030
that it's got um a solid theoretical
backing or is it something else well um

708
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
backing or is it something else well um
 

709
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,310
backing or is it something else well um
you it's clear that you want to do some

710
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:11,320
you it's clear that you want to do some
 

711
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,150
you it's clear that you want to do some
Transformations at the high level when

712
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,160
Transformations at the high level when
 

713
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,069
Transformations at the high level when
you still have the notion of you know

714
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:15,079
you still have the notion of you know
 

715
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,110
you still have the notion of you know
first class functions and um and doing

716
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,120
first class functions and um and doing
 

717
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,030
first class functions and um and doing
beta reductions and so forth so um you

718
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,040
beta reductions and so forth so um you
 

719
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,350
beta reductions and so forth so um you
so you could imagine doing that on

720
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
so you could imagine doing that on
 

721
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,310
so you could imagine doing that on
Source

722
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
Source
 

723
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,430
Source
haskal yeah but that wouldn't be much

724
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:26,440
haskal yeah but that wouldn't be much
 

725
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,749
haskal yeah but that wouldn't be much
fun because s because Source haskal has

726
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:28,759
fun because s because Source haskal has
 

727
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,710
fun because s because Source haskal has
dozens and dozens and dozens of language

728
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
dozens and dozens and dozens of language
 

729
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,310
dozens and dozens and dozens of language
constructs all of which are really

730
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
constructs all of which are really
 

731
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,189
constructs all of which are really
syntactic sugar for some smaller thing

732
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
syntactic sugar for some smaller thing
 

733
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,350
syntactic sugar for some smaller thing
right so it's much more economical to do

734
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
right so it's much more economical to do
 

735
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,910
right so it's much more economical to do
a oneoff transformation that you know

736
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
a oneoff transformation that you know
 

737
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,189
a oneoff transformation that you know
gets rid of 20 constructs in favor of

738
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:42,199
gets rid of 20 constructs in favor of
 

739
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:45,269
gets rid of 20 constructs in favor of
one and then optimize the one rather

740
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
one and then optimize the one rather
 

741
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,150
one and then optimize the one rather
than try to optimize the

742
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,160
than try to optimize the
 

743
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,470
than try to optimize the
20 right so so what you want is to have

744
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:51,480
20 right so so what you want is to have
 

745
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,710
20 right so so what you want is to have
um an intermediate language that is that

746
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:53,720
um an intermediate language that is that
 

747
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,990
um an intermediate language that is that
retains all the high levelness that you

748
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
retains all the high levelness that you
 

749
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,829
retains all the high levelness that you
need for the optimization right without

750
00:14:58,829 --> 00:14:58,839
need for the optimization right without
 

751
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,430
need for the optimization right without
any of the superficial syntactic sugar

752
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
any of the superficial syntactic sugar
 

753
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,829
any of the superficial syntactic sugar
right that's what makes it The Sweet

754
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:02,839
right that's what makes it The Sweet
 

755
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,470
right that's what makes it The Sweet
Spot I wonder if if I can ask the

756
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:05,480
Spot I wonder if if I can ask the
 

757
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,030
Spot I wonder if if I can ask the
similar question the other direction

758
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
similar question the other direction
 

759
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,629
similar question the other direction
then so if in a sense hascal boil away

760
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:11,639
then so if in a sense hascal boil away
 

761
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,110
then so if in a sense hascal boil away
all the sugar yeah and you get down to

762
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
all the sugar yeah and you get down to
 

763
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,990
all the sugar yeah and you get down to
this core but then you're saying um the

764
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
this core but then you're saying um the
 

765
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,670
this core but then you're saying um the
core of GHC is a very expressive

766
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:20,680
core of GHC is a very expressive
 

767
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,470
core of GHC is a very expressive
language could it have been boiled up to

768
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:23,480
language could it have been boiled up to
 

769
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,069
language could it have been boiled up to
a completely different looking language

770
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
a completely different looking language
 

771
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,150
a completely different looking language
is there something about hasal that pops

772
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,160
is there something about hasal that pops
 

773
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,550
is there something about hasal that pops
out of this core language or is the core

774
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
out of this core language or is the core
 

775
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,590
out of this core language or is the core
a substrate on which many languages

776
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:34,600
a substrate on which many languages
 

777
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,790
a substrate on which many languages
could be built oh no the core is a

778
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:35,800
could be built oh no the core is a
 

779
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,309
could be built oh no the core is a
substrate on which many languages could

780
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:37,319
substrate on which many languages could
 

781
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:39,110
substrate on which many languages could
be could be built you know that look

782
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
be could be built you know that look
 

783
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,710
be could be built you know that look
quite unlike Haskell really because it's

784
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:41,720
quite unlike Haskell really because it's
 

785
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,309
quite unlike Haskell really because it's
really just just a statically typed

786
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:43,319
really just just a statically typed
 

787
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,509
really just just a statically typed
Lambda calculus the big thing is that

788
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
Lambda calculus the big thing is that
 

789
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,990
Lambda calculus the big thing is that
the the thing that would make I mean

790
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,000
the the thing that would make I mean
 

791
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,230
the the thing that would make I mean
like could you take ml for example and

792
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,240
like could you take ml for example and
 

793
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,749
like could you take ml for example and
translate into core well um let's see so

794
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
translate into core well um let's see so
 

795
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,269
translate into core well um let's see so
uh uh mostly you could uh the thing is

796
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
uh uh mostly you could uh the thing is
 

797
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,990
uh uh mostly you could uh the thing is
that that ghc's called is a lazy

798
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
that that ghc's called is a lazy
 

799
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,990
that that ghc's called is a lazy
language it has um called by name

semantics um and ml is called by value
 

803
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,749

um and there's quite a lot of research

804
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
um and there's quite a lot of research
 

805
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,749
um and there's quite a lot of research
has been done about could you make a

806
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
has been done about could you make a
 

807
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,389
has been done about could you make a
single Intermediate Language in the

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
style of this core thing that was
 

811
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,790
style of this core thing that was
equally good for core by value and call

you compile many many languages to them

816
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
you compile many many languages to them
 

817
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,910
you compile many many languages to them
I think the answer is probably yes um

818
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
I think the answer is probably yes um
 

819
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,230
I think the answer is probably yes um
but the details are quite it's quite

00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
Endeavors don't often um succeed in that
 

957
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,230
Endeavors don't often um succeed in that
kind of way but sure enough it turns out

958
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,240
kind of way but sure enough it turns out
 

959
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,310
kind of way but sure enough it turns out
that haskal you know or on its own has

languages don't last nearly that long um

968
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:27,960
languages don't last nearly that long um
 

969
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,950
languages don't last nearly that long um
but so functional programming as an

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:29,960
but so functional programming as an

Enterprise has proved to be quite

972
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:31,559
Enterprise has proved to be quite
 

973
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,710
Enterprise has proved to be quite
influential in the mainstream so uh

974
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:33,720
influential in the mainstream so uh
 

975
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,950
influential in the mainstream so uh
languages like and I don't see sharp and

976
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:35,960
languages like and I don't see sharp and
 

977
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,750
languages like and I don't see sharp and
Python and so forth you can see and many

978
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
Python and so forth you can see and many
 

979
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,029
Python and so forth you can see and many
other languages you can see absorbing

980
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
other languages you can see absorbing
 

981
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,669
other languages you can see absorbing
functional language ideas now yeah yeah

982
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
functional language ideas now yeah yeah
 

983
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,350
functional language ideas now yeah yeah
alongside these two right has been

984
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:44,360
alongside these two right has been
 

985
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,270
alongside these two right has been
functional logic programming now that is

986
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
functional logic programming now that is
 

987
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,350
functional logic programming now that is
a much smaller Niche if you think

988
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
a much smaller Niche if you think
 

989
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,310
a much smaller Niche if you think
functional programming is Niche right I

990
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,320
functional programming is Niche right I
 

991
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,950
functional programming is Niche right I
don't think it's niche it's a big Niche

992
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
don't think it's niche it's a big Niche
 

993
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,070
don't think it's niche it's a big Niche
but nevertheless it isn't the mainstream

994
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,080
but nevertheless it isn't the mainstream
 

995
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,950
but nevertheless it isn't the mainstream
functional logic programming is much

996
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:56,960
functional logic programming is much
 

997
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,909
functional logic programming is much
less popular

998
00:19:58,909 --> 00:19:58,919
less popular
 

999
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,510
less popular
I haven't even heard of it and I

1000
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:00,520
I haven't even heard of it and I
 

1001
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,789
I haven't even heard of it and I
consider myself fairly well informed so

1002
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
consider myself fairly well informed so
 

1003
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,149
consider myself fairly well informed so
yeah so what's functional logic

1004
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
yeah so what's functional logic
 

1005
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,350
yeah so what's functional logic
programming well you've heard of logic

1006
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
programming well you've heard of logic
 

1007
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,909
programming well you've heard of logic
programming like prologue right um and

1008
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
programming like prologue right um and
 

1009
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,909
programming like prologue right um and
there you have logical variables and

1010
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
there you have logical variables and
 

1011
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,350
there you have logical variables and
unification is a sort of key concept

1012
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:12,360
unification is a sort of key concept
 

1013
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,950
unification is a sort of key concept
when you're um working with prologue and

1014
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
when you're um working with prologue and
 

1015
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,390
when you're um working with prologue and
you can call you can make New Logic

1016
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:17,400
you can call you can make New Logic
 

1017
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,669
you can call you can make New Logic
available you can call functions passing

1018
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
available you can call functions passing
 

1019
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,310
available you can call functions passing
them arguments that are sort of not yet

1020
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
them arguments that are sort of not yet
 

1021
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,870
them arguments that are sort of not yet
completely filled in um it's a very

1022
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:25,880
completely filled in um it's a very
 

1023
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,230
completely filled in um it's a very
different approach to programming just

1024
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,240
different approach to programming just
 

1025
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,909
different approach to programming just
as functional programming makes you

1026
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:28,919
as functional programming makes you
 

1027
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,710
as functional programming makes you
rewire your brain logic programming

1028
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
rewire your brain logic programming
 

1029
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,350
rewire your brain logic programming
makes you rewire your brain too yeah now

1030
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,360
makes you rewire your brain too yeah now
 

1031
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,750
makes you rewire your brain too yeah now
um functional logic programming has grew

1032
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:36,760
um functional logic programming has grew
 

1033
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,549
um functional logic programming has grew
out of an attempt to say well logic

1034
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
out of an attempt to say well logic
 

1035
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,950
out of an attempt to say well logic
programming is quite cool and functional

1036
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:39,960
programming is quite cool and functional
 

1037
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,230
programming is quite cool and functional
programming is quite cool could we sort

1038
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:41,240
programming is quite cool could we sort
 

1039
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,270
programming is quite cool could we sort
of somehow um merge them so one way to

1040
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,280
of somehow um merge them so one way to
 

1041
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,390
of somehow um merge them so one way to
think of it is this in

1042
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
think of it is this in
 

1043
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,070
think of it is this in
hll um you can say let x equal um I

1044
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,080
hll um you can say let x equal um I
 

1045
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,430
hll um you can say let x equal um I
don't know uh um f of 17 in blah blah

1046
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
don't know uh um f of 17 in blah blah
 

1047
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,110
don't know uh um f of 17 in blah blah
blah so that says X is a variable

1048
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
blah so that says X is a variable
 

1049
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,870
blah so that says X is a variable
that denotes a value which is the result

1050
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
that denotes a value which is the result
 

1051
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,909
that denotes a value which is the result
of f of

1052
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:02,919
of f of
 

1053
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,590
of f of
17 so we that so it does two things it

1054
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
17 so we that so it does two things it
 

1055
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,830
17 so we that so it does two things it
brings X into scope and it tells you

1056
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
brings X into scope and it tells you
 

1057
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,270
brings X into scope and it tells you
what its value is it doesn't tell you

1058
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
what its value is it doesn't tell you
 

1059
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,350
what its value is it doesn't tell you
the answer of f17 it just say you tells

1060
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360
the answer of f17 it just say you tells
 

1061
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,830
the answer of f17 it just say you tells
you that to compute its value you

1062
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:12,840
you that to compute its value you
 

1063
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,549
you that to compute its value you
compute f17 right right yeah um now but

1064
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:17,559
compute f17 right right yeah um now but
 

1065
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,149
compute f17 right right yeah um now but
nevertheless x x stands for just one

1066
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
nevertheless x x stands for just one
 

1067
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,269
nevertheless x x stands for just one
value in its scope right X doesn't stand

1068
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:23,279
value in its scope right X doesn't stand
 

1069
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,149
value in its scope right X doesn't stand
for three and then

1070
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:25,159
for three and then
 

1071
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,549
for three and then
four yeah right like in

1072
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
four yeah right like in
 

1073
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,830
four yeah right like in
if you say if you bring X into scope

1074
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:30,840
if you say if you bring X into scope
 

1075
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,310
if you say if you bring X into scope
it's a mutable cell that you then assign

1076
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,320
it's a mutable cell that you then assign
 

1077
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,870
it's a mutable cell that you then assign
to and maybe assign a different value

1078
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
to and maybe assign a different value
 

1079
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,669
to and maybe assign a different value
later and a different value later so X

1080
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:36,679
later and a different value later so X
 

1081
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,390
later and a different value later so X
is the name for a box whose value

1082
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
is the name for a box whose value
 

1083
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,190
is the name for a box whose value
changes over time in hle X is a name for

1084
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,200
changes over time in hle X is a name for
 

1085
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,590
changes over time in hle X is a name for
a value and only one value okay now in a

1086
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:44,600
a value and only one value okay now in a
 

1087
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,590
a value and only one value okay now in a
functional logic language you split the

1088
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
functional logic language you split the
 

1089
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,390
functional logic language you split the
let into two parts one is one brings X

1090
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
let into two parts one is one brings X
 

1091
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,110
let into two parts one is one brings X
into scope just says there is an X right

1092
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,120
into scope just says there is an X right
 

1093
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,149
into scope just says there is an X right
but says nothing about its

1094
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
but says nothing about its
 

1095
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,070
but says nothing about its
value and then SE separately to that you

1096
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,080
value and then SE separately to that you
 

1097
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,549
value and then SE separately to that you
can have equations that get that explain

1098
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
can have equations that get that explain
 

1099
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,390
can have equations that get that explain
something about the value of x so you

1100
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
something about the value of x so you
 

1101
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,590
something about the value of x so you
can say you can say bring X into scope

1102
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:06,600
can say you can say bring X into scope
 

1103
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,510
can say you can say bring X into scope
which in um R verse calculus we say

1104
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
which in um R verse calculus we say
 

1105
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,390
which in um R verse calculus we say
exists X right there is an X and then

1106
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
exists X right there is an X and then
 

1107
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,710
exists X right there is an X and then
somewhere in the scope of that exists

1108
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:13,720
somewhere in the scope of that exists
 

1109
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,029
somewhere in the scope of that exists
you could say x is a

1110
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:16,039
you could say x is a
 

1111
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,710
you could say x is a
pair so now you've now you've you've

1112
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
pair so now you've now you've you've
 

1113
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,190
pair so now you've now you've you've
given some extra information you said

1114
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,200
given some extra information you said
 

1115
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,430
given some extra information you said
it's not it's not a number it's not a

1116
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
it's not it's not a number it's not a
 

1117
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,350
it's not it's not a number it's not a
string it's definitely a pair but you

1118
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
string it's definitely a pair but you
 

1119
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,350
string it's definitely a pair but you
might say and it's the first and second

1120
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
might say and it's the first and second
 

1121
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,750
might say and it's the first and second
component of the pairs I'm not going to

1122
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:26,760
component of the pairs I'm not going to
 

1123
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,710
component of the pairs I'm not going to
tell you they're just Y and Zed

1124
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
tell you they're just Y and Zed
 

1125
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,590
tell you they're just Y and Zed
so you might say exists Y and Zed x

1126
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:32,600
so you might say exists Y and Zed x
 

1127
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,190
so you might say exists Y and Zed x
equals the pair y comma Zed so you've as

1128
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,200
equals the pair y comma Zed so you've as
 

1129
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,950
equals the pair y comma Zed so you've as
it were refined the value of x a little

1130
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
it were refined the value of x a little
 

1131
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,710
it were refined the value of x a little
bit okay yeah and then somewhere else

1132
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:41,720
bit okay yeah and then somewhere else
 

1133
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,350
bit okay yeah and then somewhere else
you might say first of x equals

1134
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
you might say first of x equals
 

1135
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,990
you might say first of x equals
three okay right and that's saying oh um

1136
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,000
three okay right and that's saying oh um
 

1137
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,669
three okay right and that's saying oh um
if you compute first of X which now we

1138
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:50,679
if you compute first of X which now we
 

1139
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:52,630
if you compute first of X which now we
can since we know that X is pair right

1140
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
can since we know that X is pair right
 

1141
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,950
can since we know that X is pair right
then then um then and the first

1142
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
then then um then and the first
 

1143
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,029
then then um then and the first
component remember was y then y must be

1144
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:57,039
component remember was y then y must be
 

1145
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,669
component remember was y then y must be
three

1146
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
three
 

1147
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,549
three
that's I mean that's a very unusual

1148
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:01,559
that's I mean that's a very unusual
 

1149
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,269
that's I mean that's a very unusual
thing in itself because it almost feels

1150
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:03,279
thing in itself because it almost feels
 

1151
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,110
thing in itself because it almost feels
like we're defining the something twice

1152
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,120
like we're defining the something twice
 

1153
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,310
like we're defining the something twice
well it's not we're not we're only

1154
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
well it's not we're not we're only
 

1155
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,390
well it's not we're not we're only
saying um if we if we say we could say x

1156
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:11,400
saying um if we if we say we could say x
 

1157
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,830
saying um if we if we say we could say x
equals x is the pair y z and elsewhere

1158
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:14,840
equals x is the pair y z and elsewhere
 

1159
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,269
equals x is the pair y z and elsewhere
you said x equals 3 in that case the

1160
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:17,279
you said x equals 3 in that case the
 

1161
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,710
you said x equals 3 in that case the
program would

1162
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
program would
 

1163
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,710
program would
fail right if you give contradictory

1164
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:21,720
fail right if you give contradictory
 

1165
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,149
fail right if you give contradictory
information about a one of these logical

1166
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
information about a one of these logical
 

1167
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,669
information about a one of these logical
variables right you say exist x 3 fail

1168
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
variables right you say exist x 3 fail
 

1169
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,909
variables right you say exist x 3 fail
right so deeply built into the idea of

1170
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
right so deeply built into the idea of
 

1171
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,070
right so deeply built into the idea of
functional logic programming is the idea

1172
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
functional logic programming is the idea
 

1173
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,669
functional logic programming is the idea
that a computation May Fail that is

1174
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:38,679
that a computation May Fail that is
 

1175
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,070
that a computation May Fail that is
return zero results and failure is not

1176
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,080
return zero results and failure is not
 

1177
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,590
return zero results and failure is not
necessarily

bad right failure is um any more than

1180
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:45,880
bad right failure is um any more than
 

1181
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,750
bad right failure is um any more than
false is bad or in hascal um a function

false is bad or in hascal um a function
 

1183
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,149
false is bad or in hascal um a function
a function that returns a maybe value

1184
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
a function that returns a maybe value
 

1185
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,390
a function that returns a maybe value
which is a maybe value is either just X

1186
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,400
which is a maybe value is either just X
 

1187
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,190
which is a maybe value is either just X
or it's nothing so a lookup for example

1188
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,200
or it's nothing so a lookup for example
 

1189
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,990
or it's nothing so a lookup for example
might return and maybe value so in high

1190
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
might return and maybe value so in high
 

1191
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,149
might return and maybe value so in high
school if you do a lookup and it returns

1192
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:02,159
school if you do a lookup and it returns
 

1193
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,789
school if you do a lookup and it returns
nothing the value nothing that's not

00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
nothing the value nothing that's not
 

1195
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,830
nothing the value nothing that's not
wrong it's just that the look up didn't

1196
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:06,840
wrong it's just that the look up didn't
 

1197
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,870
wrong it's just that the look up didn't
find you know the the key in the

1198
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:08,880
find you know the the key in the
 

1199
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,870

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
dictionary that's fine programming is
 

1201
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,830
dictionary that's fine programming is
like that that's you know that indeed

1202
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:12,840
like that that's you know that indeed
 

1203
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,029
like that that's you know that indeed
that might be partly what you want to do

1204
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
that might be partly what you want to do
 

1205
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,029
that might be partly what you want to do
um so um so in inverse and in functional

1206
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
um so um so in inverse and in functional
 

1207
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,149
um so um so in inverse and in functional
logic pring failure is not um like uh

1208
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,159
logic pring failure is not um like uh
 

1209
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,830
logic pring failure is not um like uh
you know seg fault crash bad things

1210
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
you know seg fault crash bad things
 

1211
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,350
you know seg fault crash bad things
happen yeah it's not a moral judgment

1212
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,360
happen yeah it's not a moral judgment
 

1213
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,630
happen yeah it's not a moral judgment
it's just they correctly is no answer to

it's just they correctly is no answer to
 

1215
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,070
it's just they correctly is no answer to
that the correctly is no answer that's

1216
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
that the correctly is no answer that's
 

1217
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,710
that the correctly is no answer that's
right in fact verse and indeed um a very

1218
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:33,720
right in fact verse and indeed um a very
 

1219
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,389
right in fact verse and indeed um a very
old language called icon um did the same

1220
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:36,399
old language called icon um did the same
 

1221
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:38,510

Haskell if you call the look up and then

1238
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:01,720
Haskell if you call the look up and then
 

1239
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,990
Haskell if you call the look up and then
you can patent match on the result and

1240
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,000
you can patent match on the result and
 

1241
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,310
you can patent match on the result and
if it's nothing you do this if it's just

1242
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
if it's nothing you do this if it's just
 

1243
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,750
if it's nothing you do this if it's just
X you do that and inverse you can just

1244
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:06,760
X you do that and inverse you can just
 

1245
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,789
X you do that and inverse you can just
say if the thing fails take this Bunch

1246
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:08,799
say if the thing fails take this Bunch
 

1247
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,710
say if the thing fails take this Bunch
otherwise take that Bunch so failure is

1248
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
otherwise take that Bunch so failure is
 

1249
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,630
otherwise take that Bunch so failure is
not it's not bad anyway so um so in this

1250
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:13,640
not it's not bad anyway so um so in this
 

1251
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,990
not it's not bad anyway so um so in this
functional logic programming Paradigm

1252
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,000
functional logic programming Paradigm
 

1253
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,310
functional logic programming Paradigm
you got um deeply wired into the very

1254
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
you got um deeply wired into the very
 

1255
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,190
you got um deeply wired into the very
fabric of computation is the idea that a

1256
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,200
fabric of computation is the idea that a
 

1257
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,909
fabric of computation is the idea that a
computation May Fail return zero results

1258
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:22,919
computation May Fail return zero results
 

1259
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,830
computation May Fail return zero results
um and in fact um inv verse it can also

1260
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:25,840
um and in fact um inv verse it can also
 

1261
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,630
um and in fact um inv verse it can also
return many results so that's a the the

1262
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:29,640
return many results so that's a the the
 

1263
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,470
return many results so that's a the the
another crucial component of functional

1264
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:31,480
another crucial component of functional
 

1265
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,230
another crucial component of functional
logic programming is

1266
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,240
logic programming is
 

1267
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,990
logic programming is
Choice um so the expression one vertical

1268
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
Choice um so the expression one vertical
 

1269
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,310
Choice um so the expression one vertical
bar

1270
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,320
bar
 

1271
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,430
bar
two returns one and then two right so an

1272
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
two returns one and then two right so an
 

1273
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,230
two returns one and then two right so an
expression can yield zero results we

1274
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,240
expression can yield zero results we
 

1275
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,789
expression can yield zero results we
call that failure one result or maybe

1276
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:47,799
call that failure one result or maybe
 

1277
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:51,310
call that failure one result or maybe
two results or maybe seven results um so

1278
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,320
two results or maybe seven results um so
 

1279
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,789
two results or maybe seven results um so
this sort of uh multiplicity of results

1280
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
this sort of uh multiplicity of results
 

1281
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,470
this sort of uh multiplicity of results
is part of the core computation model of

1282
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:57,480
is part of the core computation model of
 

1283
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,830
is part of the core computation model of
ver so as you can see it's very

1284
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:58,840
ver so as you can see it's very
 

1285
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,789
ver so as you can see it's very
different to to ordinary functional

1286
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:01,799
different to to ordinary functional
 

1287
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,389
different to to ordinary functional
programming yeah I I know someone is

1288
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:04,399
programming yeah I I know someone is
 

1289
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,389
programming yeah I I know someone is
listening to this is going to be

1290
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:05,399
listening to this is going to be
 

1291
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,510
listening to this is going to be
thinking this so I have to ask it in

1292
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:08,520
thinking this so I have to ask it in
 

1293
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,029
thinking this so I have to ask it in
what way is this not

1294
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
what way is this not
 

1295
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,710
what way is this not
just processing

1296
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:13,720
just processing
 

1297
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,230
just processing
lists

1298
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,240
lists
 

1299
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,590
lists
list it is it is a bit like making um

1300
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:18,600
list it is it is a bit like making um
 

1301
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,830
list it is it is a bit like making um
you know has Call's list monan out into

1302
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:20,840
you know has Call's list monan out into
 

1303
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,269
you know has Call's list monan out into
the fundamental monad of the

1304
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:23,279
the fundamental monad of the
 

1305
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,710
the fundamental monad of the
language um but um and you could

1306
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:27,720
language um but um and you could
 

1307
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,909
language um but um and you could
simulate verse by uh it wouldn't just be

1308
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:30,919
simulate verse by uh it wouldn't just be
 

1309
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,350
simulate verse by uh it wouldn't just be
a list monad it would be a logic team

1310
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
a list monad it would be a logic team
 

1311
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,389
a list monad it would be a logic team
monad for anybody who wants to go and

1312
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:35,399
monad for anybody who wants to go and
 

1313
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:37,510
monad for anybody who wants to go and
look up the logic T library or something

1314
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
look up the logic T library or something
 

1315
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,310
look up the logic T library or something
a bit like that because remember we got

1316
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,320
a bit like that because remember we got
 

1317
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,669
a bit like that because remember we got
to do all this unification as well yeah

1318
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:42,679
to do all this unification as well yeah
 

1319
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,510
to do all this unification as well yeah
that's the big difference so

1320
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
that's the big difference so
 

1321
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,710
that's the big difference so
um so a functional well well so one

1322
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:49,720
um so a functional well well so one
 

1323
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,149
um so a functional well well so one
possibility would be to say well why

1324
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:51,159
possibility would be to say well why
 

1325
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,510
possibility would be to say well why
don't we just do all this as a library

1326
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:52,520
don't we just do all this as a library
 

1327
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,149
don't we just do all this as a library
well the answer is it would be it would

1328
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159
well the answer is it would be it would
 

1329
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,590
well the answer is it would be it would
be possible but inconvenient right

1330
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
be possible but inconvenient right
 

1331
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,549
be possible but inconvenient right
programs would look cluttered um yeah

1332
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
programs would look cluttered um yeah
 

1333
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,070
programs would look cluttered um yeah
another way to ask the question is what

1334
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,080
another way to ask the question is what
 

1335
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,510
another way to ask the question is what
is the core

1336
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
is the core
 

1337
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,350
is the core
computational Paradigm of this

1338
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360
computational Paradigm of this
 

1339
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,710
computational Paradigm of this
functional logic thing right could we as

1340
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:07,720
functional logic thing right could we as
 

1341
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,950
functional logic thing right could we as
we were saying is we can distill hascal

1342
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:09,960
we were saying is we can distill hascal
 

1343
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,870
we were saying is we can distill hascal
down into Lambda calculus what would we

1344
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
down into Lambda calculus what would we
 

1345
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,430
down into Lambda calculus what would we
distill verse

1346
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,440
distill verse
 

1347
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,830
distill verse
into and this has been your your job

1348
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:17,840
into and this has been your your job
 

1349
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,870
into and this has been your your job
recently right that is my job recently

1350
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:19,880
recently right that is my job recently
 

1351
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,710
recently right that is my job recently
that's right so so if we're going to do

1352
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:21,720
that's right so so if we're going to do
 

1353
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,269
that's right so so if we're going to do
this functional logic programming thing

1354
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:23,279
this functional logic programming thing
 

1355
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,750
this functional logic programming thing
we better know what are you know uh what

1356
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:26,760
we better know what are you know uh what
 

1357
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,950
we better know what are you know uh what
the the absolutely essential irreducible

1358
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:29,960
the the absolutely essential irreducible
 

1359
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,549
the the absolutely essential irreducible
essence of functional logic programming

1360
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:31,559
essence of functional logic programming
 

1361
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,029
essence of functional logic programming
is if we're if we're going to undertake

1362
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
is if we're if we're going to undertake
 

1363
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,789
is if we're if we're going to undertake
this endeavor at all um and we are um so

1364
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
this endeavor at all um and we are um so
 

1365
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,669
this endeavor at all um and we are um so
indeed we spent the last um couple of

1366
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:38,679
indeed we spent the last um couple of
 

1367
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:40,470
indeed we spent the last um couple of
years

1368
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
years
 

1369
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,269
years
um identifying uh what we've called the

1370
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:43,279
um identifying uh what we've called the
 

1371
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,830
um identifying uh what we've called the
verse calculus um there was a paper at

1372
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,840
verse calculus um there was a paper at
 

1373
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,509
verse calculus um there was a paper at
um icfp last year about it um which

1374
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:49,519
um icfp last year about it um which
 

1375
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,310
um icfp last year about it um which
indeed describes a little calculus it's

1376
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,320
indeed describes a little calculus it's
 

1377
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,149
indeed describes a little calculus it's
it's bigger than the Lambda calculus

1378
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:53,159
it's bigger than the Lambda calculus
 

1379
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,750
it's bigger than the Lambda calculus
quite quite a bit bigger actually Lambda

1380
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:54,760
quite quite a bit bigger actually Lambda
 

1381
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,870
quite quite a bit bigger actually Lambda
calculus remember it's cor only has you

1382
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
calculus remember it's cor only has you
 

1383
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,549
calculus remember it's cor only has you
know variables applications and lambdas

1384
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:58,559
know variables applications and lambdas
 

1385
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,029
know variables applications and lambdas
that's incredibly sparse right verse has

1386
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039
that's incredibly sparse right verse has
 

1387
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,830
that's incredibly sparse right verse has
about you know eight so the the verse

1388
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:02,840
about you know eight so the the verse
 

1389
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,350
about you know eight so the the verse
calculus has about eight constructs or

1390
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,360
calculus has about eight constructs or
 

1391
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,509
calculus has about eight constructs or
something it's a bit bigger um but we've

1392
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:07,519
something it's a bit bigger um but we've
 

1393
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,389
something it's a bit bigger um but we've
also found a very nice way to then give

1394
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:09,399
also found a very nice way to then give
 

1395
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,070
also found a very nice way to then give
it semantics in a similar style that we

1396
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
it semantics in a similar style that we
 

1397
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,149
it semantics in a similar style that we
give the semantics of the Lambda

1398
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:13,159
give the semantics of the Lambda
 

1399
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,149
give the semantics of the Lambda
calculus how do we say what a Lambda

1400
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:15,159
calculus how do we say what a Lambda
 

1401
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,430
calculus how do we say what a Lambda
calculus program means we give it

1402
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,440
calculus program means we give it
 

1403
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,029
calculus program means we give it
rewrite rules in particular beta

1404
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
rewrite rules in particular beta
 

1405
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,950
rewrite rules in particular beta
reduction um so in the verse calculus we

1406
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:21,960
reduction um so in the verse calculus we
 

1407
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,310
reduction um so in the verse calculus we
give it we write rules

1408
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,320
give it we write rules
 

1409
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,870
give it we write rules
two you I think you need to define beta

1410
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:25,880
two you I think you need to define beta
 

1411
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,190
two you I think you need to define beta
reduction for those that don't know yes

1412
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:28,200
reduction for those that don't know yes
 

1413
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,509
reduction for those that don't know yes
so um so it's a bit difficult to do this

1414
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:31,519
so um so it's a bit difficult to do this
 

1415
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,430
so um so it's a bit difficult to do this
without uh whiteboard but what is what

1416
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
without uh whiteboard but what is what
 

1417
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,990
without uh whiteboard but what is what
is a what is a um the

1418
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,000
is a what is a um the
 

1419
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,870
is a what is a um the
own in when Alonzo church first defined

1420
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
own in when Alonzo church first defined
 

1421
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,509
own in when Alonzo church first defined
the lamb calculus he defined this

1422
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:40,519
the lamb calculus he defined this
 

1423
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,350
the lamb calculus he defined this
incredibly tiny calculus which is um

1424
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
incredibly tiny calculus which is um
 

1425
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,509
incredibly tiny calculus which is um
just variables applications and lambdas

1426
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:45,519
just variables applications and lambdas
 

1427
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,470
just variables applications and lambdas
and the only the only rewrite rule is if

1428
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:47,480
and the only the only rewrite rule is if
 

1429
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,549
and the only the only rewrite rule is if
you have a Lambda applied to an argument

1430
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:49,559
you have a Lambda applied to an argument
 

1431
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,990
you have a Lambda applied to an argument
think about a function applied to an

1432
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
think about a function applied to an
 

1433
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,269
think about a function applied to an
argument then what do you do you take

1434
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:54,279
argument then what do you do you take
 

1435
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,389
argument then what do you do you take
the body of the of the function and you

1436
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:57,399
the body of the of the function and you
 

1437
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,029
the body of the of the function and you
replace the call with the body having

1438
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
replace the call with the body having
 

1439
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,870
replace the call with the body having
replace the bound variable with the

1440
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
replace the bound variable with the
 

1441
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,669
replace the bound variable with the
actual argument so you sort of rewriting

1442
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
actual argument so you sort of rewriting
 

1443
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,430
actual argument so you sort of rewriting
the function to be you're rewriting the

1444
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:08,440
the function to be you're rewriting the
 

1445
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,950
the function to be you're rewriting the
function call yeah to have a copy of the

1446
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:11,960
function call yeah to have a copy of the
 

1447
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,430
function call yeah to have a copy of the
function

1448
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
function
 

1449
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,669
function
body yeah so if I have um I don't know

1450
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:16,679
body yeah so if I have um I don't know
 

1451
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,549
body yeah so if I have um I don't know
if I say um one bat of X is x^2 + 1 then

1452
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:21,559
if I say um one bat of X is x^2 + 1 then
 

1453
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,669
if I say um one bat of X is x^2 + 1 then
if I see one bat of three I can replace

1454
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
if I see one bat of three I can replace
 

1455
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,590
if I see one bat of three I can replace
that with 3^2 + 1 if I see one bat of 77

1456
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:26,600
that with 3^2 + 1 if I see one bat of 77
 

1457
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,909
that with 3^2 + 1 if I see one bat of 77
I replace that with 77 s + 1 yeah right

1458
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:29,919
I replace that with 77 s + 1 yeah right
 

1459
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,950
I replace that with 77 s + 1 yeah right
so each call is replaced by a copy of

1460
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:31,960
so each call is replaced by a copy of
 

1461
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,190
so each call is replaced by a copy of
the body um with the actual argument

1462
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
the body um with the actual argument
 

1463
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,070
the body um with the actual argument
substituted for the formal

1464
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,080
substituted for the formal
 

1465
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,669
substituted for the formal
parameter that is beta reduction that

1466
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679
parameter that is beta reduction that
 

1467
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,070
parameter that is beta reduction that
step of replacing the call by the copy

1468
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,080
step of replacing the call by the copy
 

1469
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,389
step of replacing the call by the copy
of the body after substituting that's

1470
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:45,399
of the body after substituting that's
 

1471
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:49,950
of the body after substituting that's
beta right and astonishingly that single

1472
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:49,960
beta right and astonishingly that single
 

1473
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,430
beta right and astonishingly that single
thing is enough to define a

1474
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:52,440
thing is enough to define a
 

1475
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,909
thing is enough to define a
computationally complete language that

1476
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:53,919
computationally complete language that
 

1477
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,710
computationally complete language that
is a you know a a uh it's enough to

1478
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
is a you know a a uh it's enough to
 

1479
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,950
is a you know a a uh it's enough to
Define any any computation whatsoever in

1480
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
Define any any computation whatsoever in
 

1481
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,350
Define any any computation whatsoever in
the you know in the two in complete

1482
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:00,360
the you know in the two in complete
 

1483
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,590
the you know in the two in complete
sense it's amazing that that one rule is

1484
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:02,600
sense it's amazing that that one rule is
 

1485
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,950
sense it's amazing that that one rule is
enough that that's punching massively

1486
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:05,960
enough that that's punching massively
 

1487
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,630
enough that that's punching massively
above its weight it is amazing right

1488
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640
above its weight it is amazing right
 

1489
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,310
above its weight it is amazing right
it's you know just gobsmackingly

in the you know late 1920s early 1930s
was defining this calculus with with a

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,000
expressive as a toing machine you know
 

1503
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,470
expressive as a toing machine you know
they're into expressive it's not too

1504
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:25,480
they're into expressive it's not too
 

1505
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,710
they're into expressive it's not too
surprising that we figured out how

1506
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:27,720
surprising that we figured out how
 

1507
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,909
surprising that we figured out how
useful that was from touring side

1508
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:30,919
useful that was from touring side
 

1509
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:33,310
useful that was from touring side
building machines

1510
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,320
building machines
 

1511
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,669
building machines
upwards but yeah but it's interesting

1512
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
upwards but yeah but it's interesting
 

1513
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,029
upwards but yeah but it's interesting
that now time has rolled on and we've

1514
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:38,039
that now time has rolled on and we've
 

1515
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,310
that now time has rolled on and we've
realized that you can go from the maths

1516
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
realized that you can go from the maths
 

1517
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,669
realized that you can go from the maths
down to get it to exactly the same place

1518
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:42,679
down to get it to exactly the same place
 

1519
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:44,149
down to get it to exactly the same place
yeah that's right I mean they realized

1520
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
yeah that's right I mean they realized
 

1521
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,269
yeah that's right I mean they realized
they were inter um you know they were

1522
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:46,279
they were inter um you know they were
 

1523
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,470
they were inter um you know they were
each as expressive as the other they

1524
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:47,480
each as expressive as the other they
 

1525
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,870
each as expressive as the other they
realized that very early on um but the

1526
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:49,880
realized that very early on um but the
 

1527
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,750
realized that very early on um but the
thing about touring machines Is that

1528
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
thing about touring machines Is that
 

1529
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,149
thing about touring machines Is that
real machines you know actual you know

1530
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
real machines you know actual you know
 

1531
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,950
real machines you know actual you know
what what whatever it is you know x86

1532
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:55,960
what what whatever it is you know x86
 

1533
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,029
what what whatever it is you know x86
processors they look much more like

1534
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:58,039
processors they look much more like
 

1535
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,950
processors they look much more like
touring machines yeah in which the

1536
00:30:59,950 --> 00:30:59,960
touring machines yeah in which the
 

1537
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,990
touring machines yeah in which the
memory is the tape that is mutated by

1538
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000
memory is the tape that is mutated by
 

1539
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,350
memory is the tape that is mutated by
the processor that is like the head of

1540
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
the processor that is like the head of
 

1541
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,789
the processor that is like the head of
the touring machine so it's quite a

1542
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
the touring machine so it's quite a
 

1543
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,590
the touring machine so it's quite a
close connection between um the touring

1544
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,600
close connection between um the touring
 

1545
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,549
close connection between um the touring
Machine model of computation and what

1546
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:09,559
Machine model of computation and what
 

1547
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,149
Machine model of computation and what
really happens in our microprocesses

1548
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
really happens in our microprocesses
 

1549
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,190
really happens in our microprocesses
yeah yeah and the the sort of functional

1550
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,200
yeah yeah and the the sort of functional
 

1551
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,750
yeah yeah and the the sort of functional
programming stuff has taken a bit longer

1552
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:15,760
programming stuff has taken a bit longer
 

1553
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,269
programming stuff has taken a bit longer
to say well it's equally expressive but

1554
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:18,279
to say well it's equally expressive but
 

1555
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,950
to say well it's equally expressive but
if we build a good compiler we can map

1556
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:19,960
if we build a good compiler we can map
 

1557
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,870
if we build a good compiler we can map
it onto the same x86 processor yeah and

1558
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:23,880
it onto the same x86 processor yeah and
 

1559
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,669
it onto the same x86 processor yeah and
that is the that actually is the step we

1560
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
that is the that actually is the step we
 

1561
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,870
that is the that actually is the step we
were discussing earlier when we go from

1562
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:27,880
were discussing earlier when we go from
 

1563
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,710
were discussing earlier when we go from
Lambda calculus down to lrvm or C minus

1564
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
Lambda calculus down to lrvm or C minus
 

1565
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,470
Lambda calculus down to lrvm or C minus
minus yeah okay so going back to this

1566
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:35,480
minus yeah okay so going back to this
 

1567
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,789
minus yeah okay so going back to this
core which I really want to explore more

1568
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:37,799
core which I really want to explore more
 

1569
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,070
core which I really want to explore more
boiling

1570
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,080
boiling
 

1571
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,190
boiling
down we've got to go high level in a

1572
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,200
down we've got to go high level in a
 

1573
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,190
down we've got to go high level in a
second but boiling down this uh

1574
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:44,200
second but boiling down this uh
 

1575
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,990
second but boiling down this uh

into verse core you've called it you've

1578
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:50,679
into verse core you've called it you've
 

1579
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:52,750
into verse core you've called it you've
ended up with a batch of uh you say

1580
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:52,760
ended up with a batch of uh you say
 

1581
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,909
ended up with a batch of uh you say
eight rules oh no that we have I think I

1582
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
eight rules oh no that we have I think I
 

1583
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,750
eight rules oh no that we have I think I
forget the exact number do we have

1584
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
forget the exact number do we have
 

1585
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,430
forget the exact number do we have
alas rather more than eight rules

1586
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
alas rather more than eight rules
 

1587
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,029
alas rather more than eight rules
there's more like 20 or so I think I can

1588
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:02,039
there's more like 20 or so I think I can
 

1589
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,870
there's more like 20 or so I think I can
look at the paper but the I was meaning

1590
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:03,880
look at the paper but the I was meaning
 

1591
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,509
look at the paper but the I was meaning
the the number of syntactic

1592
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
the the number of syntactic
 

1593
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,909
the the number of syntactic
constructs calculus only three or four

1594
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:07,919
constructs calculus only three or four
 

1595
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,389
constructs calculus only three or four
we have more like sort of eight or 10 I

1596
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:09,399
we have more like sort of eight or 10 I
 

1597
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,990
we have more like sort of eight or 10 I
think in the verse calculus okay but

1598
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
think in the verse calculus okay but
 

1599
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,230
think in the verse calculus okay but
this core I mean does it the thing one

1600
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,240
this core I mean does it the thing one
 

1601
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,750
this core I mean does it the thing one
thing I want to know is can you look at

1602
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
thing I want to know is can you look at
 

1603
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,310
thing I want to know is can you look at
the two different cores and get a sense

1604
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,320
the two different cores and get a sense
 

1605
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,590
the two different cores and get a sense
of what the final language is going to

1606
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:22,600
of what the final language is going to
 

1607
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,070
of what the final language is going to
feel like to work with I does does it

1608
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,080
feel like to work with I does does it
 

1609
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,750
feel like to work with I does does it
have is there functional logic Zen the

1610
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
have is there functional logic Zen the
 

1611
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,669
have is there functional logic Zen the
fun the Tower of it buried in this core

1612
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:32,679
fun the Tower of it buried in this core
 

1613
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,149
fun the Tower of it buried in this core
language oh there is I mean I think I

1614
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:34,159
language oh there is I mean I think I
 

1615
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,070
language oh there is I mean I think I
think

1616
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,080
think
 

1617
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,070
think
it's a core calculus is the sort of the

1618
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,080
it's a core calculus is the sort of the
 

1619
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,350
it's a core calculus is the sort of the
essence of what computation means in

1620
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
essence of what computation means in
 

1621
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,110
essence of what computation means in
that Paradigm incidentally the Lambda

1622
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,120
that Paradigm incidentally the Lambda
 

1623
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,590
that Paradigm incidentally the Lambda
calculus is a subset of the verse

1624
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
calculus is a subset of the verse
 

1625
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,669
calculus is a subset of the verse
calculus yeah oh is it yeah so every

1626
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:48,679
calculus yeah oh is it yeah so every
 

1627
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,710
calculus yeah oh is it yeah so every
Lambda term is a verse calculus term um

1628
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
Lambda term is a verse calculus term um
 

1629
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,190
Lambda term is a verse calculus term um
so it's just that verse calculus has you

1630
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,200
so it's just that verse calculus has you
 

1631
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,750
so it's just that verse calculus has you
know a bit more that doesn't make it

1632
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:55,760
know a bit more that doesn't make it
 

1633
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,070
know a bit more that doesn't make it
computationally more powerful but we

1634
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,080
computationally more powerful but we
 

1635
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,190
computationally more powerful but we
know that the Lambda calculus is

1636
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,200
know that the Lambda calculus is
 

1637
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,029
know that the Lambda calculus is
computationally complete but it but it

1638
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:00,039
computationally complete but it but it
 

1639
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,629
computationally complete but it but it
has these additional you know functional

1640
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:02,639
has these additional you know functional
 

1641
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:04,350
has these additional you know functional
logic features built into its

1642
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:04,360
logic features built into its
 

1643
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,629
logic features built into its
infrastructure and rewrite rules to

1644
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:05,639
infrastructure and rewrite rules to
 

1645
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,990
infrastructure and rewrite rules to
support them um but indeed I think when

1646
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
support them um but indeed I think when
 

1647
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,629
support them um but indeed I think when
you stare at the rewrite rules if you

1648
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:09,639
you stare at the rewrite rules if you
 

1649
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:11,149
you stare at the rewrite rules if you
look at the you look at the paper you'll

1650
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:11,159
look at the you look at the paper you'll
 

1651
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,389
look at the you look at the paper you'll
get uh you will you will get you know

1652
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:13,399
get uh you will you will get you know
 

1653
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:14,950
get uh you will you will get you know
some sense of you won't get a sense of

1654
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
some sense of you won't get a sense of
 

1655
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,909
some sense of you won't get a sense of
what it's like to write um you know

1656
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:16,919
what it's like to write um you know
 

1657
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,909
what it's like to write um you know
programs in inversed in the large but I

1658
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:18,919
programs in inversed in the large but I
 

1659
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,430
programs in inversed in the large but I
think you'll get a sense of what what um

1660
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
think you'll get a sense of what what um
 

1661
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,549
think you'll get a sense of what what um
uh what computation means and what what

1662
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:23,559
uh what computation means and what what
 

1663
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,950
uh what computation means and what what
you can say in this little little

1664
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:25,960
you can say in this little little
 

1665
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,470
you can say in this little little
language

1666
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:27,480
language
 

1667
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,070
language
and what we're saying is I get the sense

1668
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,080
and what we're saying is I get the sense
 

1669
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,430
and what we're saying is I get the sense
is a version of programming

1670
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:34,440
is a version of programming
 

1671
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,990
is a version of programming
where that there's so imperative

1672
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
where that there's so imperative
 

1673
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,710
where that there's so imperative
languages you define what needs to be

1674
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:39,720
languages you define what needs to be
 

1675
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,350
languages you define what needs to be
done functional languages you define

1676
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:42,360
done functional languages you define
 

1677
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,710
done functional languages you define
what is it feels like the verse you're

1678
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:45,720
what is it feels like the verse you're
 

1679
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,029
what is it feels like the verse you're
going to be

1680
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:47,039
going to be
 

1681
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,149
going to be
defining the shape of things as best you

1682
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,159
defining the shape of things as best you
 

1683
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,950
defining the shape of things as best you
know them now and gradually building up

1684
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:51,960
know them now and gradually building up
 

1685
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,430
know them now and gradually building up
a picture of the constraints around the

1686
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:54,440
a picture of the constraints around the
 

1687
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,269
a picture of the constraints around the
answer yeah that's a bit like that and

1688
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:57,279
answer yeah that's a bit like that and
 

1689
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,430
answer yeah that's a bit like that and
in some ways that's an even higher level

1690
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
in some ways that's an even higher level
 

1691
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,590
in some ways that's an even higher level
right we we so that functional in

1692
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:01,600
right we we so that functional in
 

1693
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,909
right we we so that functional in
functional program we say it's

1694
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:02,919
functional program we say it's
 

1695
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:04,190
functional program we say it's
declarative what do we mean by

1696
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,200
declarative what do we mean by
 

1697
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,710
declarative what do we mean by
declarative programming like it's what

1698
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:05,720
declarative programming like it's what
 

1699
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,149
declarative programming like it's what
you were saying what is rather than um

1700
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
you were saying what is rather than um
 

1701
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,389
you were saying what is rather than um
you know how to compute it so you know

1702
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:11,399
you know how to compute it so you know
 

1703
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,589
you know how to compute it so you know
crudely you might say imperative

1704
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:12,599
crudely you might say imperative
 

1705
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,149
crudely you might say imperative
programming say how and in functional

1706
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:14,159
programming say how and in functional
 

1707
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,349
programming say how and in functional
programming say what and we've you know

1708
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:16,359
programming say what and we've you know
 

1709
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:19,310
programming say what and we've you know
rather sloppily said well that must be

1710
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:19,320
rather sloppily said well that must be
 

1711
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,669
rather sloppily said well that must be
better

1712
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:20,679
better
 

1713
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,550
better
right but but um uh but in a functional

1714
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:25,560
right but but um uh but in a functional
 

1715
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,829
right but but um uh but in a functional
logic language you're even higher level

1716
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:27,839
logic language you're even higher level
 

1717
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,230
logic language you're even higher level
rather than saying um how can I give an

1718
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,240
rather than saying um how can I give an
 

1719
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,710
rather than saying um how can I give an
example if I say um uh find me the X

1720
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
example if I say um uh find me the X
 

1721
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,829
example if I say um uh find me the X
such that x s is is um

1722
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
such that x s is is um
 

1723
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,869
such that x s is is um
22 then I'm asking you to find the

1724
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:39,879
22 then I'm asking you to find the
 

1725
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,869
22 then I'm asking you to find the
square root of x right so that's a very

1726
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:41,879
square root of x right so that's a very
 

1727
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,629
square root of x right so that's a very
high level thing right it's not a square

1728
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:43,639
high level thing right it's not a square
 

1729
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,190
high level thing right it's not a square
root algorithm it's completely

1730
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
root algorithm it's completely
 

1731
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,030
root algorithm it's completely
non-constructive right it simply tells

1732
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,040
non-constructive right it simply tells
 

1733
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,629
non-constructive right it simply tells
you a property of the number you want

1734
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:50,639
you a property of the number you want
 

1735
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,430
you a property of the number you want
yeah right but it's very

1736
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:54,440
yeah right but it's very
 

1737
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,270
yeah right but it's very
expressive that's good right and and you

1738
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:58,280
expressive that's good right and and you
 

1739
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,510
expressive that's good right and and you
you can see immediately what it does if

1740
00:34:59,510 --> 00:34:59,520
you can see immediately what it does if
 

1741
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,069
you can see immediately what it does if
I showed you a square root algorithm it

1742
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:01,079
I showed you a square root algorithm it
 

1743
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,230
I showed you a square root algorithm it
would be hard to figure out what it does

1744
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,240
would be hard to figure out what it does
 

1745
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,790
would be hard to figure out what it does
if I just say my spec is uh you know the

1746
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
if I just say my spec is uh you know the
 

1747
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,790
if I just say my spec is uh you know the
X such that X squ is um uh 22 then you

1748
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
X such that X squ is um uh 22 then you
 

1749
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,030
X such that X squ is um uh 22 then you
say ah now I know what you're doing

1750
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
say ah now I know what you're doing
 

1751
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,390
say ah now I know what you're doing
right so this kind of um tell me the

1752
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
right so this kind of um tell me the
 

1753
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,829
right so this kind of um tell me the
properties of the

1754
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:18,839
properties of the
 

1755
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,670
properties of the
result way of describing what you want a

1756
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680
result way of describing what you want a
 

1757
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,390
result way of describing what you want a
computer to do because after all that's

1758
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,400
computer to do because after all that's
 

1759
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,270
computer to do because after all that's
what programming is describe the

1760
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:26,280
what programming is describe the
 

1761
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,829
what programming is describe the
properties of the result is a

1762
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:28,839
properties of the result is a
 

1763
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,710
properties of the result is a
rather highlevel way to tell your

1764
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:31,720
rather highlevel way to tell your
 

1765
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,150
rather highlevel way to tell your
computer what to

1766
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,160
computer what to
 

1767
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,710
computer what to
do right as we've seen from this x squ

1768
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:35,720
do right as we've seen from this x squ
 

1769
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,750
do right as we've seen from this x squ
thing now um inverse you can say um

1770
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:39,760
thing now um inverse you can say um
 

1771
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,829
thing now um inverse you can say um
exists X x^2 = 22 and try to run that

1772
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:42,839
exists X x^2 = 22 and try to run that
 

1773
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,470
exists X x^2 = 22 and try to run that
but it will get

1774
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
but it will get
 

1775
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,030
but it will get
stuck right it's not it's not an illegal

1776
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
stuck right it's not it's not an illegal
 

1777
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,030
stuck right it's not it's not an illegal
program but it but it's one that um it's

1778
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
program but it but it's one that um it's
 

1779
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,910
program but it but it's one that um it's
one that we can't

1780
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:50,920
one that we can't
 

1781
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,390
one that we can't
um uh we can't we're not going to

1782
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:53,400
um uh we can't we're not going to
 

1783
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,309
um uh we can't we're not going to
succeed in executing right because the

00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:55,319
succeed in executing right because the

the property we've asked it to figure

1786
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:56,680
the property we've asked it to figure
 

1787
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,069
the property we've asked it to figure
out out is too hard we've asked it to

1788
00:35:59,069 --> 00:35:59,079
out out is too hard we've asked it to
 

1789
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,670
out out is too hard we've asked it to
guess a square root algorithm right yeah

1790
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:01,680
guess a square root algorithm right yeah
 

1791
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,069
guess a square root algorithm right yeah
yeah but if I say um uh uh an X and Y

1792
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:07,079
yeah but if I say um uh uh an X and Y
 

1793
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,430
yeah but if I say um uh uh an X and Y
and Zed such that X is the pair y z and

1794
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,440
and Zed such that X is the pair y z and
 

1795
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,109
and Zed such that X is the pair y z and
um and the first component of X is three

1796
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
um and the first component of X is three
 

1797
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,510
um and the first component of X is three
and the second component of X is four

1798
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
and the second component of X is four
 

1799
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,150
and the second component of X is four
then I've given you enough information

1800
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,160
then I've given you enough information
 

1801
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,790
then I've given you enough information
very straightforwardly to solve those

1802
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:18,800
very straightforwardly to solve those
 

1803
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,630
very straightforwardly to solve those
equations and say ah why must be three

1804
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:21,640
equations and say ah why must be three
 

1805
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,750
equations and say ah why must be three
Zed must be four and X must be the pair

1806
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:23,760
Zed must be four and X must be the pair
 

1807
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,670
Zed must be four and X must be the pair
three four yeah right so the um uh so so

1808
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
three four yeah right so the um uh so so
 

1809

can
 

1833
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,309
can
you give it sales problem as the spec

1834
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:02,319
you give it sales problem as the spec
 

1835
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:03,550
you give it sales problem as the spec
and expect the answers you just

1836
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:03,560
and expect the answers you just
 

1837
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,030
and expect the answers you just
magically pop out and that's not going

1838
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,040
magically pop out and that's not going
 

1839
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,390
magically pop out and that's not going
to happen yeah they L apart exactly yeah

so what is what is from um a questions

1842
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:12,440
so what is what is from um a questions
 

1843
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,069
so what is what is from um a questions
this can answer conveniently point of

1844
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:15,079
this can answer conveniently point of
 

1845
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,589
this can answer conveniently point of
view what is functional logic

00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599
view what is functional logic
 

1847
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,990
view what is functional logic
programming good for ah yes so that's

1848
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,000
programming good for ah yes so that's
 

1849
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,710
programming good for ah yes so that's
that's a good question right so so then

1850
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:21,720
that's a good question right so so then
 

1851
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,470
that's a good question right so so then

better way to do the job right in the T
TK of telling a computer what you wanted

1886
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,160
TK of telling a computer what you wanted
 

1887
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,550
TK of telling a computer what you wanted
to do functional programming is just

1888
00:37:59,550 --> 00:37:59,560
to do functional programming is just
 

1889
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,910
to do functional programming is just
better um that is to say you're less lik

1890
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:02,920
better um that is to say you're less lik
 

1891
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,069
better um that is to say you're less lik
to make mistakes um you're You' be more

1892
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:05,079
to make mistakes um you're You' be more
 

1893
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,670
to make mistakes um you're You' be more
productive and um uh maybe our programs

1894
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:07,680
productive and um uh maybe our programs
 

1895
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,670
productive and um uh maybe our programs
be who knows depends how hard we work on

1896
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:09,680
be who knows depends how hard we work on
 

1897
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,390
be who knows depends how hard we work on
a compiler maybe our maybe our programs

1898
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:11,400
a compiler maybe our maybe our programs
 

1899
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,829
a compiler maybe our maybe our programs
will run a little slower but maybe not

1900
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:12,839
will run a little slower but maybe not
 

1901
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,550
will run a little slower but maybe not
much um and maybe they'll be highly

1902
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:14,560
much um and maybe they'll be highly
 

1903
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,309
much um and maybe they'll be highly
parallel who knows so but it's just a

1904
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:16,319
parallel who knows so but it's just a
 

1905
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:19,510
parallel who knows so but it's just a
better way to do the job now um

1906
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,520
better way to do the job now um
 

1907
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,589
better way to do the job now um
functional logic programming maybe

1908
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:21,599
functional logic programming maybe
 

1909
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,990
functional logic programming maybe
that's a better way to write programs

1910
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,000
that's a better way to write programs
 

1911
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,190
that's a better way to write programs
right maybe it's just um so I've argued

1912
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:26,200
right maybe it's just um so I've argued
 

1913
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,550
right maybe it's just um so I've argued
that it's more expressive that to say

1914
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:27,560
that it's more expressive that to say
 

1915
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,109
that it's more expressive that to say
it's more expressive and a higher level

1916
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:29,119
it's more expressive and a higher level
 

1917
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,510
it's more expressive and a higher level
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a

1918
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,520
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a
 

1919
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,829
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a
better programming medium because it

1920
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:32,839
better programming medium because it
 

1921
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:34,630
better programming medium because it
might be extremely obscure for example

1922
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:34,640
might be extremely obscure for example
 

1923
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,190
might be extremely obscure for example
or hard to understand programs for some

1924
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,200
or hard to understand programs for some
 

1925
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,430
or hard to understand programs for some
reason yeah so I think that the um um

1926
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:40,440
reason yeah so I think that the um um
 

1927
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,069
reason yeah so I think that the um um

games um yeah firmly believes that

1932
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:49,880
games um yeah firmly believes that
 

1933
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,510
games um yeah firmly believes that
functional logic programming is just the

1934
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:51,520
functional logic programming is just the
 

1935
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,150
functional logic programming is just the
right way to write programs in the same

1936
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,160
right way to write programs in the same
 

1937
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,309
right way to write programs in the same
way that I firmly believed you know age

1938
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:55,319
way that I firmly believed you know age
 

1939
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:57,990
way that I firmly believed you know age
20 uh that functional programing was

1940
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
20 uh that functional programing was
 

1941
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,990
20 uh that functional programing was
just the right way to do things um and

1942
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
just the right way to do things um and
 

1943
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,150
just the right way to do things um and
I've you know placed my bets on that and

1944
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,160
I've you know placed my bets on that and
 

1945
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,550
I've you know placed my bets on that and
Tim is putting his money on functional

1946
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:03,560
Tim is putting his money on functional
 

1947
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,990
Tim is putting his money on functional
logic programming at the moment I think

1948
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,000
logic programming at the moment I think
 

1949
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,950
logic programming at the moment I think
there's a um uh I think that's a uh the

1950
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:09,960
there's a um uh I think that's a uh the
 

1951
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,109
there's a um uh I think that's a uh the
good thing about that is it means that

1952
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,119
good thing about that is it means that
 

1953
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,670
good thing about that is it means that
verse takes a view right it is

1954
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:13,680
verse takes a view right it is
 

1955
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,710
verse takes a view right it is
expressing a a a strongly held and well

1956
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:17,720
expressing a a a strongly held and well
 

1957
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,069
expressing a a a strongly held and well
worked out view of what programming

1958
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:19,079
worked out view of what programming
 

1959
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,670
worked out view of what programming
should be like um so that's quite

1960
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:20,680
should be like um so that's quite
 

1961
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,430
should be like um so that's quite
exciting for me as a programming

1962
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:22,440
exciting for me as a programming
 

1963
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,109
exciting for me as a programming
language researcher um is it do we know

1964
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:26,119
language researcher um is it do we know
 

1965
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,829
language researcher um is it do we know
that it's going to be a better way to

1966
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
that it's going to be a better way to
 

1967
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,390
that it's going to be a better way to
write programs even supposing programs

1968
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:29,400
write programs even supposing programs
 

1969
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,589
write programs even supposing programs
run fast enough and so forth um is it

1970
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:31,599
run fast enough and so forth um is it
 

1971
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,829
run fast enough and so forth um is it
better way to write programs um I don't

1972
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:33,839
better way to write programs um I don't
 

1973
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,510
better way to write programs um I don't
know it could be but I think we'll get a

1974
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
know it could be but I think we'll get a
 

1975
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,870
know it could be but I think we'll get a
lot of the only way we'll really find

1976
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:36,880
lot of the only way we'll really find
 

1977
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,870
lot of the only way we'll really find
out is by trying it and that's what

1978
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:38,880
out is by trying it and that's what
 

1979
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,790
out is by trying it and that's what
we're doing yeah so uh so Tim is

1980
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:41,800
we're doing yeah so uh so Tim is
 

1981
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,030
we're doing yeah so uh so Tim is
convinced I'm um uh I think there's a uh

1982
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,040
convinced I'm um uh I think there's a uh
 

1983
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,349
convinced I'm um uh I think there's a uh
a extremely interesting you know

1984
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:48,359
a extremely interesting you know
 

1985
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,190
a extremely interesting you know
experiment to be done here um and I'm

1986
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,200
experiment to be done here um and I'm
 

1987
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,309
experiment to be done here um and I'm
prepared to be convinced um but I'm not

1988
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:52,319
prepared to be convinced um but I'm not
 

1989
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:54,270
prepared to be convinced um but I'm not
yet in the this is just definitely so

1990
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:54,280
yet in the this is just definitely so
 

1991
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,589
yet in the this is just definitely so
much better Camp yeah well that's fair

1992
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:56,599
much better Camp yeah well that's fair
 

1993
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,430
much better Camp yeah well that's fair
cuz um you are on the spectrum of um

1994
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:00,440

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,790
you're way over the first end of the

right I'm you know my principal goal in
 

2003
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,270
right I'm you know my principal goal in
all of this is sort of it's an

all of this is sort of it's an
intellectual Adventure yeah but of

2006
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:13,560
intellectual Adventure yeah but of
 

2007
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,069
intellectual Adventure yeah but of
course the intellectual Adventures are

2008
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:15,079
course the intellectual Adventures are
 

2009
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,309
course the intellectual Adventures are
dramatically informed by practical usage

2010
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:17,319
dramatically informed by practical usage
 

2011
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:19,390
dramatically informed by practical usage
I'm strongly motivated by the fact that

who will start using verse um and that's
 

2033
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,069
who will start using verse um and that's
very motivating too because I want it to

works for them and is um uh and is you

2038
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:51,640
works for them and is um uh and is you
 

2039
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,950
works for them and is um uh and is you
know smooth and uh and it you know it's

2040
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:54,960
know smooth and uh and it you know it's
 

2041
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,870
know smooth and uh and it you know it's
just sort of obvious what it does

2042
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
just sort of obvious what it does
 

2043
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,510
just sort of obvious what it does
uh whether we'll whether we'll succeed

2044
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
uh whether we'll whether we'll succeed
 

2045
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,430
uh whether we'll whether we'll succeed
in doing all of those things we'll have

2046
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
in doing all of those things we'll have
 

2047
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,150
in doing all of those things we'll have
to see but that's that's the aspiration

2048
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:03,160
to see but that's that's the aspiration
 

2049
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,750
to see but that's that's the aspiration
and we do have a big user base um yeah

2050
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:07,760
and we do have a big user base um yeah
 

2051
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,150
and we do have a big user base um yeah
it's it's reminding me of objective c

2052
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
it's it's reminding me of objective c
 

2053
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,109
it's it's reminding me of objective c

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,069
programmers just popped up having to
find out how useful and interesting this

2062
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
find out how useful and interesting this
 

2063
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,230
find out how useful and interesting this
was and we're going to see the same with

ECT I think so I mean you can at the
 

2069
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,750
ECT I think so I mean you can at the
moment you can program with unreal using

00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
moment you can program with unreal using
 

2071

um and you can also use a lang a visual

2074
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:37,720
um and you can also use a lang a visual
 

2075
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,910
um and you can also use a lang a visual
language called

00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:38,920
language called
 

2077
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,470

blueprints um which is uh you know it's

2078
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,480
blueprints um which is uh you know it's
 

2079
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,950
blueprints um which is uh you know it's
a visual language in the sense that you

2080
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:43,960
a visual language in the sense that you
 

2081
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,950
a visual language in the sense that you
draw boxes and arrows between them and

2082
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:45,960
draw boxes and arrows between them and
 

2083
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,710
draw boxes and arrows between them and
the arrows can be data flow arcs or they

2084
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:48,720
the arrows can be data flow arcs or they
 

2085
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,829
the arrows can be data flow arcs or they
can be control flow dependencies yeah

2086
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
can be control flow dependencies yeah
 

2087
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,430
can be control flow dependencies yeah
but of course there's a there's somewhat

2088
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
but of course there's a there's somewhat
 

2089
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,150
but of course there's a there's somewhat
a limit about about what sort of

00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
blueprints so then you have to descend
 

2095
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,990
blueprints so then you have to descend

so um and he has been designing verse in

2172
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:40,800
so um and he has been designing verse in
 

2173
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,829
so um and he has been designing verse in
his head for the last two decades oh

2174
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:43,839
his head for the last two decades oh
 

2175
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,510
his head for the last two decades oh
really that just that he's been also yes

2176
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:45,520
really that just that he's been also yes
 

2177
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,430
really that just that he's been also yes
a long time long time it's also he's

2178
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,440
a long time long time it's also he's
 

2179
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,790
a long time long time it's also he's
been busy making epic successful as well

2180
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:50,800
been busy making epic successful as well
 

2181
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,750
been busy making epic successful as well
so it's been a kind of you know uh

2182
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
so it's been a kind of you know uh
 

2183
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,430
so it's been a kind of you know uh
evenings and weekends activity for him

2184
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:55,440
evenings and weekends activity for him
 

2185
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,430
evenings and weekends activity for him
for ages and

2186
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
for ages and
 

2187
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,069
for ages and
ages uh and so

2188
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:01,079
ages uh and so
 

2189
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:04,630
ages uh and so
um so my job is as it were to uh to

2190
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:04,640
um so my job is as it were to uh to
 

2191
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,309
um so my job is as it were to uh to
figure out what verse is you know what

2192
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:07,319
figure out what verse is you know what

figure out what verse is you know what
this thing in his head is and it's full

2194
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:09,559
this thing in his head is and it's full
 

2195
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:11,829
this thing in his head is and it's full
of interesting and original ideas um and

2196
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:11,839
of interesting and original ideas um and
 

2197
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,670
of interesting and original ideas um and
then try to make sense of it all now uh

2198
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:14,680
then try to make sense of it all now uh
 

2199
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,190
then try to make sense of it all now uh
supposing we discovered it just doesn't

2200
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:16,200
supposing we discovered it just doesn't
 

2201
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,549
supposing we discovered it just doesn't
make sense well we we haven't discovered

2202
00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:19,559
make sense well we we haven't discovered
 

2203
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,990
make sense well we we haven't discovered
that yet but I'm I'm uh

2204
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,000
that yet but I'm I'm uh
 

2205
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,589
that yet but I'm I'm uh
I I firmly believe that if we could

2206
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:28,599
I I firmly believe that if we could
 

2207
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,910
I I firmly believe that if we could
persuade Tim that something really

2208
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:29,920
persuade Tim that something really
 

2209
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,670
persuade Tim that something really
didn't make sense he would say oh Japs

2210
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:32,680
didn't make sense he would say oh Japs
 

2211
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,790
didn't make sense he would say oh Japs
we can't possibly do

2212
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:35,800

 

2213
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,109

that you must have found that as you

00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
that you must have found that as you
 

2215
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,790
that you must have found that as you
dive right into the very gut of it you

00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:42,800
dive right into the very gut of it you
 

2217
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,109

00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
language then there must be
 

2223
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,430

00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:52,440
inconsistencies that you only discover

00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,910

when you're trying to formalize
 

2227
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,829
when you're trying to formalize
something well we are formalizing from

00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:55,839
something well we are formalizing from
 

2229
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,309
something well we are formalizing from
the the bottom up so you know we sort of

2230
00:44:57,309 --> 00:44:57,319
the the bottom up so you know we sort of
 

2231
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,630
the the bottom up so you know we sort of
starting with the you know the core

2232
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,640
starting with the you know the core

2234
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:01,240
calculus that's what this um uh this
 

2235
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,270
calculus that's what this um uh this
paper is about um but um Tim has been

2236
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:04,280
paper is about um but um Tim has been
 

2237
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,150
paper is about um but um Tim has been
thinking about this long a long time so

2238
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,160
thinking about this long a long time so
 

2239
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,270
thinking about this long a long time so
the the the um uh the whole thing the

2240
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:09,280
the the the um uh the whole thing the
 

2241
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,589
the the the um uh the whole thing the
whole enchilada including uh its type

2242
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
whole enchilada including uh its type
 

2243
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,390
whole enchilada including uh its type
system and verification and

2244
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:13,400
system and verification and
 

2245
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,829
system and verification and
transactional memory and side effects um

2246
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:16,839
transactional memory and side effects um
 

2247
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,990
transactional memory and side effects um
and uh classes and inheritance and so

2248
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:19,000
and uh classes and inheritance and so
 

2249
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,309
and uh classes and inheritance and so
forth and backward compatibility the

2250
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:21,319
forth and backward compatibility the
 

2251
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,270
forth and backward compatibility the
whole thing is Jolly complicated yeah um

2252
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:24,280
whole thing is Jolly complicated yeah um
 

2253
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,790
whole thing is Jolly complicated yeah um
so um

2254
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:26,800
so um
 

2255
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,109
so um
I guess what I mean is once you

2256
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:28,119
I guess what I mean is once you
 

2257
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:29,910
I guess what I mean is once you
formalize this calculus and you start

2258
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920
formalize this calculus and you start
 

2259
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,109
formalize this calculus and you start
building up that Tower are you going to

2260
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:32,119
building up that Tower are you going to
 

2261
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,150
building up that Tower are you going to
find you end up with something that kind

2262
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:35,160
find you end up with something that kind
 

2263
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,349
find you end up with something that kind
of that doesn't quite look exactly like

2264
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:38,359
of that doesn't quite look exactly like
 

2265
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,150
of that doesn't quite look exactly like
verse you going to say okay there's a

2266
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160
verse you going to say okay there's a
 

2267
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,470
verse you going to say okay there's a
new release of verse and we've got to

2268
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:41,480
new release of verse and we've got to
 

2269
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,510
new release of verse and we've got to
change the semantics because I don't

2270
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:43,520
change the semantics because I don't
 

2271
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,710
change the semantics because I don't
know so so far we haven't okay so far we

2272
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
know so so far we haven't okay so far we
 

2273
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,430
know so so far we haven't okay so far we
haven't G across any ins superable

2274
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:48,440
haven't G across any ins superable
 

2275
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,470
haven't G across any ins superable
obstacles as it were which I think is

2276
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:50,480
obstacles as it were which I think is

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,870
obstacles as it were which I think is
also also Testament to um Tim's sort of

2278
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:53,880
also also Testament to um Tim's sort of
 

2279
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,790
also also Testament to um Tim's sort of
single single-mindedness um I'm reminded

2280
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
single single-mindedness um I'm reminded
 

2281
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,910
single single-mindedness um I'm reminded
incidentally of rust here um uh rust was

2282
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:00,920
incidentally of rust here um uh rust was
 

2283
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,270
incidentally of rust here um uh rust was
a language that was um designed with you

2284
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:03,280
a language that was um designed with you
 

2285
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,510
a language that was um designed with you
know strong attention to sharing and

2286
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
know strong attention to sharing and
 

2287
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,190
know strong attention to sharing and
borrowing and linearity and so forth um

2288
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:08,200
borrowing and linearity and so forth um
 

2289
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,430
borrowing and linearity and so forth um
and but it was designed it was very much

2290
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:10,440
and but it was designed it was very much
 

2291
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,190

00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:12,200
didn't come out of a university and a
 

2293
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,990
didn't come out of a university and a
sort of pointy-headed academic it came

2294
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,000
sort of pointy-headed academic it came
 

2295
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,309
sort of pointy-headed academic it came
out came out of a sort of a desire to to

2296
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:16,319
out came out of a sort of a desire to to
 

2297
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,670
out came out of a sort of a desire to to
do good practice so I was pretty sure

2298
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:20,680
do good practice so I was pretty sure
 

2299
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,230
do good practice so I was pretty sure
that when somebody came to do the theory

2300
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:23,240
that when somebody came to do the theory
 

2301
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,990
that when somebody came to do the theory
behind rust right they would find all

2302
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,000
behind rust right they would find all
 

2303
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,230
behind rust right they would find all
sorts of holes in the type

2304
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,240
sorts of holes in the type
 

2305
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,109
sorts of holes in the type
system right maybe not ones that uh

2306
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
system right maybe not ones that uh
 

2307
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,990
system right maybe not ones that uh
occurred in practice very much but just

2308
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,000
occurred in practice very much but just
 

2309
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,829
occurred in practice very much but just
that there would be you know uh uh holes

2310
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:36,839
that there would be you know uh uh holes
 

2311
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:38,549
that there would be you know uh uh holes
in which which would allow you to write

2312
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:38,559
in which which would allow you to write
 

2313
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:40,109
in which which would allow you to write
programs in Rust that simply weren't

00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:40,119
programs in Rust that simply weren't
 

2315
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:42,270
programs in Rust that simply weren't
correct you know that were disobeyed

rust's um what guarantees astonishingly

00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,280
rust's um what guarantees astonishingly

Dreer and his colleagues have done a lot

2322
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,040
Dreer and his colleagues have done a lot
 

2323
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,150
Dreer and his colleagues have done a lot
of stuff on the foundations um of rust

2324
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:53,160
of stuff on the foundations um of rust
 

2325
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,470
of stuff on the foundations um of rust
and actually didn't find any major uh

2326
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
and actually didn't find any major uh
 

2327
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,510

you know theoretical inconsistencies um

2328
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,520
you know theoretical inconsistencies um
 

2329
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,670
you know theoretical inconsistencies um
that's amazing that means that the

2330
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:01,680
that's amazing that means that the
 

2331
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,109
that's amazing that means that the
original designers uh had incredibly you

but they actually got it right it's an
 

2337
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,390
but they actually got it right it's an
amazing thing which is Jolly complicated

00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:11,400
amazing thing which is Jolly complicated

00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,510
think do you have any theories on why
that might be do you think it's just

2348
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:20,520
that might be do you think it's just
 

2349
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,510
that might be do you think it's just
lightning struck they're just very

2350
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:22,520
lightning struck they're just very
 

2351
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,109
lightning struck they're just very
hardworking and clever or do you think

2352
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:24,119
hardworking and clever or do you think
 

2353
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,109
hardworking and clever or do you think
there's something about comp computers

2354
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:26,119
there's something about comp computers
 

2355
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,990
there's something about comp computers
keeping us honest uh no I think they

2356
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,000
keeping us honest uh no I think they
 

2357
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,790
keeping us honest uh no I think they
probably just well I computers do keep

2358
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:31,800
probably just well I computers do keep
 

2359
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,109
probably just well I computers do keep
you honest but there's an awful lot of

2360
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
you honest but there's an awful lot of
 

2361
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,950
you honest but there's an awful lot of
potential programs possible programs

2362
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:34,960
potential programs possible programs
 

2363
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,030
potential programs possible programs
that you could write um and many of them

2364
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,040
that you could write um and many of them
 

2365
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,910
that you could write um and many of them
you know might have uh you know

2366
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:38,920
you know might have uh you know
 

2367
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,109
you know might have uh you know
linearity flaws in them that were not

2368
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:41,119
linearity flaws in them that were not
 

2369
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,470
linearity flaws in them that were not
really apparent or don't show up even

2370
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480
really apparent or don't show up even
 

2371
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,230
really apparent or don't show up even
when you run it so so no I don't think

2372
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,240
when you run it so so no I don't think
 

2373
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,750
when you run it so so no I don't think
it I I think it's just they're extremely

2374
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:46,760
it I I think it's just they're extremely
 

2375
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,430
it I I think it's just they're extremely
clever and had very very well educated

2376
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:49,440
clever and had very very well educated
 

2377
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,470
clever and had very very well educated
intuitions that they sort of developed

2378
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:51,480
intuitions that they sort of developed
 

2379
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,230
intuitions that they sort of developed
over

2380
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:52,240
over
 

2381
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,510
over
time and so you must be claiming

2382
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:54,520
time and so you must be claiming
 

2383
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,510
time and so you must be claiming
something similar for ver if you're

2384
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:56,520
something similar for ver if you're
 

2385
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,910
something similar for ver if you're
going to formalize these things and

2386
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:57,920
going to formalize these things and
 

2387
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,190
going to formalize these things and
finding their what I'm saying so so far

2388
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:00,200
finding their what I'm saying so so far
 

2389
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,470
finding their what I'm saying so so far
as I say Tim's Tim's intuitions have

2390
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:02,480
as I say Tim's Tim's intuitions have
 

2391
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,109
as I say Tim's Tim's intuitions have
proved remarkably uh you know one might

2392
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119
proved remarkably uh you know one might
 

2393
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,870
proved remarkably uh you know one might
disagree about matters of taste right so

2394
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:06,880
disagree about matters of taste right so
 

2395
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,470
disagree about matters of taste right so
is it worth having this this piece of

2396
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:08,480
is it worth having this this piece of
 

2397
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,390
is it worth having this this piece of
complexity in order to allow that kind

2398
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,400
complexity in order to allow that kind
 

2399
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,510
complexity in order to allow that kind
of expressiveness you know you can make

2400
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:12,520
of expressiveness you know you can make
 

2401
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,190
of expressiveness you know you can make
choices about that but what we haven't

2402
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:14,200
choices about that but what we haven't
 

2403
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,390
choices about that but what we haven't
found is the thing is just a mess and

2404
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
found is the thing is just a mess and
 

2405
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,790
found is the thing is just a mess and
doesn't hold together at all is just

2406
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:17,800
doesn't hold together at all is just
 

2407
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,349
doesn't hold together at all is just
inconsistent in some way right yeah so

2408
00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:20,359
inconsistent in some way right yeah so
 

2409
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:22,030
inconsistent in some way right yeah so
and I think that is Testament as I say

2410
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:22,040
and I think that is Testament as I say
 

2411
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,150
and I think that is Testament as I say
to his single-mindedness and his sort of

2412
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,160
to his single-mindedness and his sort of
 

2413
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,510
to his single-mindedness and his sort of
technical intuition okay well in that

2414
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:26,520
technical intuition okay well in that
 

2415
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,990
technical intuition okay well in that
case let's talk about climbing this

2416
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,000
case let's talk about climbing this
 

2417
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,510
case let's talk about climbing this
ladder a bit more because um I I

2418
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
ladder a bit more because um I I
 

2419
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,910
ladder a bit more because um I I
absolutely don't want to sit a test on

2420
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:33,920
absolutely don't want to sit a test on
 

2421
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,829
absolutely don't want to sit a test on
this but I have read the verse Core

2422
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:35,839
this but I have read the verse Core
 

2423
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,069
this but I have read the verse Core
paper and enjoyed it and you hint that

2424
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:39,079
paper and enjoyed it and you hint that
 

2425
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:41,670
paper and enjoyed it and you hint that
you're going to be climbing up into

2426
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:41,680
you're going to be climbing up into
 

2427
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,430
you're going to be climbing up into
formalizing side effects and types yeah

2428
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:46,440
formalizing side effects and types yeah
 

2429
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,789
formalizing side effects and types yeah
how's that work going oh well so um

2430
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:49,799
how's that work going oh well so um
 

2431
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:50,990
how's that work going oh well so um
let's talk about types because that's

2432
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:51,000
let's talk about types because that's
 

2433
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,470
let's talk about types because that's
really the the next big thing

2434
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:54,480
really the the next big thing
 

2435
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,309
really the the next big thing
so uh um so versus typee system is very

2436
00:48:59,309 --> 00:48:59,319
so uh um so versus typee system is very
 

2437
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:02,270
so uh um so versus typee system is very
unusual so usually like in language like

2438
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:02,280
unusual so usually like in language like
 

2439
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,710
unusual so usually like in language like
has school you have the world of terms

2440
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:03,720
has school you have the world of terms
 

2441
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,190
has school you have the world of terms
and then separately have the world of

2442
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:05,200
and then separately have the world of
 

2443
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,030
and then separately have the world of
types um and types are you know a

2444
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:08,040
types um and types are you know a
 

2445
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,109
types um and types are you know a
somewhat special language in particular

2446
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:10,119
somewhat special language in particular
 

2447
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:13,069
somewhat special language in particular
you can statically reason about types so

2448
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:13,079
you can statically reason about types so
 

2449
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:15,349
you can statically reason about types so
the type Checker can say this program is

2450
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:15,359
the type Checker can say this program is
 

2451
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,870
the type Checker can say this program is
well typed this program is not well

2452
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:18,880
well typed this program is not well
 

2453
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,030
well typed this program is not well
typed now in verse uh a type is more

2454
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,040
typed now in verse uh a type is more
 

2455
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,750
typed now in verse uh a type is more
like a contract in

2456
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:26,760
like a contract in
 

2457
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,630
like a contract in
scheme so a type is actually just a

2458
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:29,640
scheme so a type is actually just a
 

2459
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,670
scheme so a type is actually just a
function a function inverse actually um

2460
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:33,680
function a function inverse actually um
 

2461
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,510
function a function inverse actually um
and it's a function which uh either

2462
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:36,520
and it's a function which uh either
 

2463
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,870
and it's a function which uh either
fails in the sense we've been discussing

2464
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
fails in the sense we've been discussing
 

2465
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,190
fails in the sense we've been discussing
given an argument it either fails or

2466
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:42,200
given an argument it either fails or
 

2467
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,109
given an argument it either fails or
let's say for now or it's the identity

2468
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:44,119
let's say for now or it's the identity
 

2469
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:46,950
let's say for now or it's the identity
function so the int type is just the

2470
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
function so the int type is just the
 

2471
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,990
function so the int type is just the
function that takes a value tests

2472
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:49,000
function that takes a value tests
 

2473
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,549
function that takes a value tests
whether it's an INT and if it is it

2474
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:51,559
whether it's an INT and if it is it
 

2475
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,589
whether it's an INT and if it is it
returns it and if it isn't it

2476
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:53,599
returns it and if it isn't it
 

2477
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,190
returns it and if it isn't it
fails make sense right yeah yeah so it's

2478
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,200
fails make sense right yeah yeah so it's
 

2479
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,150
fails make sense right yeah yeah so it's
almost like a filter if you like um yeah

2480
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:01,160
almost like a filter if you like um yeah
 

2481
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,829
almost like a filter if you like um yeah
just but it but it fails if it isn't the

2482
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:02,839
just but it but it fails if it isn't the
 

2483
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:06,390
just but it but it fails if it isn't the
type so um let's see the type int comma

2484
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:06,400
type so um let's see the type int comma
 

2485
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,390
type so um let's see the type int comma
int the type of pairs of ins is a

2486
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:09,400
int the type of pairs of ins is a
 

2487
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,990
int the type of pairs of ins is a
function that takes an argument um

2488
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
function that takes an argument um
 

2489
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,870
function that takes an argument um
checks that uh it is a pair if not it

2490
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
checks that uh it is a pair if not it
 

2491
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,510
checks that uh it is a pair if not it
fails then applies int to the first

2492
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:17,520
fails then applies int to the first
 

2493
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,829
fails then applies int to the first
component and applies int to the second

2494
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:19,839
component and applies int to the second
 

2495
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,430
component and applies int to the second
component remember apply to means check

2496
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:22,440
component remember apply to means check
 

2497
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,750
component remember apply to means check
that it has that type because int is a

2498
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:24,760
that it has that type because int is a
 

2499
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,230
that it has that type because int is a
function

2500
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
function
 

2501
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,230
function
so so the pair int comma int is also a

2502
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:29,240
so so the pair int comma int is also a
 

2503
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,670
so so the pair int comma int is also a
function is also a type which which does

2504
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
function is also a type which which does
 

2505
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,710
function is also a type which which does
this

2506
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:32,720
this
 

2507
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,710
this
thing so any so um uh you can Define the

2508
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:37,720
thing so any so um uh you can Define the
 

2509
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,990
thing so any so um uh you can Define the
type say of pairs in which the second

2510
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:40,000
type say of pairs in which the second
 

2511
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,750
type say of pairs in which the second
component is bigger than the

2512
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:42,760
component is bigger than the
 

2513
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,789
component is bigger than the
first oh that's an unusual type that is

2514
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:45,799
first oh that's an unusual type that is
 

2515
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:47,470
first oh that's an unusual type that is
it's just a function that takes an

2516
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:47,480
it's just a function that takes an
 

2517
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,030
it's just a function that takes an
argument I you could write this function

2518
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,040
argument I you could write this function
 

2519
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,950
argument I you could write this function
inverse right just a just a function

2520
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
inverse right just a just a function
 

2521
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,309
inverse right just a just a function
takes an argument checks if it's a pair

2522
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:53,319
takes an argument checks if it's a pair
 

2523
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:54,670
takes an argument checks if it's a pair
if it is a pair check the first

2524
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:54,680
if it is a pair check the first
 

2525
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,230
if it is a pair check the first
component is an in

2526
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
component is an in
 

2527
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,829
component is an in
check that the second component is in it

2528
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
check that the second component is in it
 

2529
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,990
check that the second component is in it
and then check that the first component

2530
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,000
and then check that the first component
 

2531
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,549
and then check that the first component
is bigger than the

2532
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:01,559
is bigger than the
 

2533
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,270
is bigger than the
second and fail if

2534
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:04,280
second and fail if
 

2535
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,069
second and fail if
not so it becomes very much that there's

2536
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:08,079
not so it becomes very much that there's
 

2537
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,829
not so it becomes very much that there's
a unification there

2538
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
a unification there
 

2539
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,109
a unification there
between Type statements saying we

2540
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:13,119
between Type statements saying we
 

2541
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,950
between Type statements saying we
constrain these values to these

2542
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:15,960
constrain these values to these
 

2543
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,030
constrain these values to these
rules and logic functional logic

2544
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,040
rules and logic functional logic
 

2545
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,430
rules and logic functional logic
programming in general saying we

2546
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:20,440
programming in general saying we
 

2547
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,349
programming in general saying we
constrain these values to these

2548
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:24,359
constrain these values to these
 

2549
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:27,030
constrain these values to these
rules there's there's less separation

2550
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
rules there's there's less separation
 

2551
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,750
rules there's there's less separation
between those worlds yeah maybe but I I

2552
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:29,760
between those worlds yeah maybe but I I
 

2553
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,950
between those worlds yeah maybe but I I
think it's I think in the typ connection

2554
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:31,960
think it's I think in the typ connection
 

2555
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,789
think it's I think in the typ connection
I think is that uh a type is just a

2556
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:34,799
I think is that uh a type is just a
 

2557
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:36,270
I think is that uh a type is just a
partial function partial in the sense

2558
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:36,280
partial function partial in the sense
 

2559
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,829
partial function partial in the sense
that it can fail so do remember we said

2560
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:37,839
that it can fail so do remember we said
 

2561
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,190
that it can fail so do remember we said
failure is deeply built into the fabric

2562
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:40,200
failure is deeply built into the fabric
 

2563
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,030
failure is deeply built into the fabric
and we could make that you know done by

2564
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:42,040
and we could make that you know done by
 

2565
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,829
and we could make that you know done by
some kind of list monad but then it'd be

2566
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
some kind of list monad but then it'd be
 

2567
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,030
some kind of list monad but then it'd be
much more Awkward to say and types do

2568
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:46,040
much more Awkward to say and types do
 

2569
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,510
much more Awkward to say and types do
this so so here um that's what a that's

2570
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:49,520
this so so here um that's what a that's
 

2571
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,670
this so so here um that's what a that's
what a type does but now since a type is

2572
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:52,680
what a type does but now since a type is
 

2573
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,109
what a type does but now since a type is
just um you know since I can write new

2574
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:55,119
just um you know since I can write new
 

2575
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,309
just um you know since I can write new
type new types are just new functions

2576
00:51:57,309 --> 00:51:57,319
type new types are just new functions
 

2577
00:51:57,319 --> 00:51:58,789
type new types are just new functions
that I write as a

2578
00:51:58,789 --> 00:51:58,799
that I write as a
 

2579
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:01,069
that I write as a
user right so I don't write have a

2580
00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:01,079
user right so I don't write have a
 

2581
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:02,510
user right so I don't write have a
different language for defining new

2582
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:02,520
different language for defining new
 

2583
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,030
different language for defining new
types new types are simply ordinary old

2584
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
types new types are simply ordinary old
 

2585
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,190
types new types are simply ordinary old
verse function definitions but that

2586
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:07,200
verse function definitions but that
 

2587
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,230
verse function definitions but that
means that the type

2588
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:09,240
means that the type
 

2589
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,549
means that the type
Checker has to

2590
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:11,559
Checker has to
 

2591
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,789
Checker has to
understand well these ordinary old verse

2592
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:13,799
understand well these ordinary old verse
 

2593
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:16,309
understand well these ordinary old verse
function definitions you've just

2594
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:16,319
function definitions you've just
 

2595
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,789
function definitions you've just
written so the type Checker has to be to

2596
00:52:19,789 --> 00:52:19,799
written so the type Checker has to be to
 

2597
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:22,510
written so the type Checker has to be to
run verse programs

2598
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:22,520
run verse programs
 

2599
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,589
run verse programs
exactly the type Checker has to be able

2600
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:24,599
exactly the type Checker has to be able
 

2601
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,829
exactly the type Checker has to be able
to run verse program s yes and of course

2602
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:27,839
to run verse program s yes and of course
 

2603
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,670
to run verse program s yes and of course
you might write something that is

2604
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:29,680
you might write something that is
 

2605
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,349
you might write something that is
extremely hard to check right so um

2606
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:35,359

 

2607
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,710

uh it would not be difficult to write a

2608
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:37,720
uh it would not be difficult to write a
 

2609
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,910
uh it would not be difficult to write a
program with a a contract you know or

2610
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:39,920
program with a a contract you know or
 

2611
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,630
program with a a contract you know or
type that was sufficiently complicated

2612
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:41,640
type that was sufficiently complicated
 

2613
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,510
type that was sufficiently complicated
that it was hard to be sure that the

2614
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:43,520
that it was hard to be sure that the
 

2615
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,750
that it was hard to be sure that the
first argument was going to be bigger

2616
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:44,760
first argument was going to be bigger
 

2617
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,230
first argument was going to be bigger
than the

2618
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,240
than the
 

2619
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,829
than the
second right yeah like uh I don't know

2620
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:49,839
second right yeah like uh I don't know
 

2621
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,829
second right yeah like uh I don't know
um uh say you had a type that was true

2622
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:52,839
um uh say you had a type that was true
 

2623
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:55,750
um uh say you had a type that was true
only of positive numbers and you said is

2624
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
only of positive numbers and you said is
 

2625
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,430
only of positive numbers and you said is
x squ in that

2626
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:58,440
x squ in that
 

2627
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,390
x squ in that
type well yes it is because we know that

2628
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,400
type well yes it is because we know that
 

2629
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,589
type well yes it is because we know that
um if I mean if x is an INT we know that

2630
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:04,599
um if I mean if x is an INT we know that
 

2631
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,390
um if I mean if x is an INT we know that
squares are always positive yeah but

2632
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:07,400
squares are always positive yeah but
 

2633
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,630
squares are always positive yeah but
that's a property of numbers right so

2634
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
that's a property of numbers right so
 

2635
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,109
that's a property of numbers right so
maybe the verify knows about that

2636
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:12,119
maybe the verify knows about that
 

2637
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,390
maybe the verify knows about that
property of

2638
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:13,400
property of
 

2639
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,950
property of
numbers but you can cook up some more

2640
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:15,960
numbers but you can cook up some more
 

2641
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,430
numbers but you can cook up some more
difficult property of

2642
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:17,440
difficult property of
 

2643
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,470
difficult property of
numbers the the the so you can see You'd

2644
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
numbers the the the so you can see You'd
 

2645
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,270
numbers the the the so you can see You'd
rapidly get into arbitrary theorem

2646
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,280
rapidly get into arbitrary theorem
 

2647
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,710
rapidly get into arbitrary theorem
proving yeah yeah right so instead of

2648
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:26,720
proving yeah yeah right so instead of
 

2649
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,630
proving yeah yeah right so instead of
calling it type checking we call it

2650
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:30,640
calling it type checking we call it
 

2651
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,190
calling it type checking we call it
verification okay and the idea is still

2652
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200
verification okay and the idea is still
 

2653
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,829
verification okay and the idea is still
going to be that just as the the

2654
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:35,839
going to be that just as the the
 

2655
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,910
going to be that just as the the
purposes of type Checker is to say it

2656
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
purposes of type Checker is to say it
 

2657
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,549
purposes of type Checker is to say it
eliminates certain classes of bug so the

2658
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:39,559
eliminates certain classes of bug so the
 

2659
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:42,870
eliminates certain classes of bug so the
slogan is well typed programs don't go

2660
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:42,880
slogan is well typed programs don't go
 

2661
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,549
slogan is well typed programs don't go
wrong where going wrong means some

2662
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
wrong where going wrong means some
 

2663
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,309
wrong where going wrong means some
particular class of Errors like adding

2664
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:48,319
particular class of Errors like adding
 

2665
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,309
particular class of Errors like adding
an integer to a booon right hascal means

2666
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:51,319
an integer to a booon right hascal means
 

2667
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:53,069
an integer to a booon right hascal means
you can't that could never happen at

2668
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:53,079
you can't that could never happen at
 

2669
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:56,910
you can't that could never happen at
runtime right yeah so if you imagine a

2670
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:56,920
runtime right yeah so if you imagine a
 

2671
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,109
runtime right yeah so if you imagine a
runtime which manipulated integers and

2672
00:53:59,109 --> 00:53:59,119
runtime which manipulated integers and
 

2673
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,789
runtime which manipulated integers and
booleans are sort of tagged values so

2674
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:00,799
booleans are sort of tagged values so
 

2675
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:03,750
booleans are sort of tagged values so
you could tell them apart at runtime and

2676
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:03,760
you could tell them apart at runtime and
 

2677
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,230
you could tell them apart at runtime and
then your addition operation did a

2678
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:05,240
then your addition operation did a
 

2679
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,670
then your addition operation did a
runtime

2680
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:06,680
runtime
 

2681
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,910
runtime
test you would know that that runtime

2682
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:08,920
test you would know that that runtime
 

2683
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,430
test you would know that that runtime
test would never fail yeah right and

2684
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:12,440
test would never fail yeah right and
 

2685
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,230
test would never fail yeah right and
therefore you can emit all those

2686
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
therefore you can emit all those
 

2687
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,230
therefore you can emit all those
one-time tests and indeed the tags that

2688
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,240
one-time tests and indeed the tags that
 

2689
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,630
one-time tests and indeed the tags that
distinguish integers from booleans right

2690
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,640
distinguish integers from booleans right
 

2691
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,750
distinguish integers from booleans right
yeah good now in ver verse is going to

2692
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:21,760
yeah good now in ver verse is going to
 

2693
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,390
yeah good now in ver verse is going to
be like that in the sense that um

2694
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:24,400
be like that in the sense that um
 

2695
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,870
be like that in the sense that um
verified prrams don't go

2696
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:26,880
verified prrams don't go
 

2697
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,230
verified prrams don't go
wrong right so if the verifier says

2698
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:29,240
wrong right so if the verifier says
 

2699
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,829
wrong right so if the verifier says
thumbs up your program is verified then

2700
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
thumbs up your program is verified then
 

2701
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,230
thumbs up your program is verified then
a certain class of Errors cannot occur

2702
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
a certain class of Errors cannot occur
 

2703
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,270
a certain class of Errors cannot occur
and the implementation could be

2704
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,280
and the implementation could be
 

2705
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,789
and the implementation could be
corresponding more efficient but it's

2706
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:37,799
corresponding more efficient but it's
 

2707
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:40,230
corresponding more efficient but it's
possible that the verifier might say I'm

2708
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:40,240
possible that the verifier might say I'm
 

2709
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,950
possible that the verifier might say I'm
sorry I can't prove that your program

2710
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
sorry I can't prove that your program
 

2711
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,030
sorry I can't prove that your program
verifies because it requires me knowing

2712
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,040
verifies because it requires me knowing
 

2713
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,349
verifies because it requires me knowing
say that u x squ is always positive and

2714
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:48,359
say that u x squ is always positive and
 

2715
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:50,349
say that u x squ is always positive and
I haven't been taught that yet so over

2716
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:50,359
I haven't been taught that yet so over
 

2717
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:52,710
I haven't been taught that yet so over
time I expect the verse verifier to get

2718
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:52,720
time I expect the verse verifier to get
 

2719
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,990
time I expect the verse verifier to get
more powerful more smarter right yeah as

2720
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,000
more powerful more smarter right yeah as
 

2721
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,150
more powerful more smarter right yeah as
it's taught rules for more and more

2722
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:58,160
it's taught rules for more and more
 

2723
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,430
it's taught rules for more and more
complex time exactly but there won't be

2724
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:00,440
complex time exactly but there won't be
 

2725
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,390
complex time exactly but there won't be
unlike hascal there won't be a clean

2726
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
unlike hascal there won't be a clean
 

2727
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,230
unlike hascal there won't be a clean
bright line between programs that can be

2728
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:05,240
bright line between programs that can be
 

2729
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,069
bright line between programs that can be
verified and programs that

2730
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:07,079
verified and programs that
 

2731
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:10,150
verified and programs that
can't yes right because it'll be a

2732
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
can't yes right because it'll be a
 

2733
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,990
can't yes right because it'll be a
function of just how smart has the

2734
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:12,000
function of just how smart has the
 

2735
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,069
function of just how smart has the
verifier become on any one day we might

2736
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:15,079
verifier become on any one day we might
 

2737
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,549
verifier become on any one day we might
hope to characterize as precisely as

2738
00:55:17,549 --> 00:55:17,559
hope to characterize as precisely as
 

2739
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:19,109
hope to characterize as precisely as
possible where that boundary lies but it

2740
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
possible where that boundary lies but it
 

2741
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,230
possible where that boundary lies but it
is a boundary that will move over time

2742
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:21,240
is a boundary that will move over time
 

2743
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,990
is a boundary that will move over time
do you think that verifier will ever be

2744
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,000
do you think that verifier will ever be
 

2745
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,670
do you think that verifier will ever be
user

2746
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:25,680
user
 

2747
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,630
user
manipulatable in that you will write

2748
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:27,640
manipulatable in that you will write
 

2749
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,789
manipulatable in that you will write
more rules for the verifier again in oh

2750
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:30,799
more rules for the verifier again in oh
 

2751
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:33,549
more rules for the verifier again in oh
possibly um yes I mean you want to be a

2752
00:55:33,549 --> 00:55:33,559
possibly um yes I mean you want to be a
 

2753
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:35,230
possibly um yes I mean you want to be a
bit careful because if the user adds a

2754
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:35,240
bit careful because if the user adds a
 

2755
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,470
bit careful because if the user adds a
rule that is simply false then you know

2756
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:37,480
rule that is simply false then you know
 

2757
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,870
rule that is simply false then you know
the program might crash yeah and it

2758
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:39,880
the program might crash yeah and it
 

2759
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,549
the program might crash yeah and it
might crash in a truly horrible way

2760
00:55:41,549 --> 00:55:41,559
might crash in a truly horrible way
 

2761
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:44,589
might crash in a truly horrible way
right so um like it might just simply be

2762
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:44,599
right so um like it might just simply be
 

2763
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:48,270
right so um like it might just simply be
a seg fold um yeah so you'd want to be a

2764
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:48,280
a seg fold um yeah so you'd want to be a
 

2765
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,990
a seg fold um yeah so you'd want to be a
bit careful about allowing you but but

2766
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:51,000
bit careful about allowing you but but
 

2767
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,230
bit careful about allowing you but but
if you um uh if you essentially add some

2768
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:55,240
if you um uh if you essentially add some
 

2769
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,789
if you um uh if you essentially add some
you know some new things to the verifier

2770
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:56,799
you know some new things to the verifier
 

2771
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,069
you know some new things to the verifier
that says make this part of the trusted

2772
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,079
that says make this part of the trusted
 

2773
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,870
that says make this part of the trusted
code base if this is wrong all bets are

2774
00:55:59,870 --> 00:55:59,880
code base if this is wrong all bets are
 

2775
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,029
code base if this is wrong all bets are
off then that's a POS imaginable

2776
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:03,039
off then that's a POS imaginable
 

2777
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,470
off then that's a POS imaginable
possibility yeah yeah okay do you think

2778
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:06,480
possibility yeah yeah okay do you think
 

2779
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,270
possibility yeah yeah okay do you think
I mean I'm thinking verse if if the

2780
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:09,280
I mean I'm thinking verse if if the
 

2781
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,309
I mean I'm thinking verse if if the
verifier is just more verse functions

2782
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:12,319
verifier is just more verse functions
 

2783
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,150
verifier is just more verse functions
yeah this leads into side effects I

2784
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,160
yeah this leads into side effects I
 

2785
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,950
yeah this leads into side effects I
could in theory Define a type which was

2786
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:16,960
could in theory Define a type which was
 

2787
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,829
could in theory Define a type which was
the the type of all strings which are a

2788
00:56:20,829 --> 00:56:20,839
the the type of all strings which are a
 

2789
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:24,230
the the type of all strings which are a
valid username in my database yes that's

2790
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
valid username in my database yes that's
 

2791
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,109
valid username in my database yes that's
right that might very have time or space

2792
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:26,119
right that might very have time or space
 

2793
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,470
right that might very have time or space
and who knows so so I think for us types

2794
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
and who knows so so I think for us types
 

2795
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,910
and who knows so so I think for us types
are going to be pure functions yeah so

2796
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:30,920
are going to be pure functions yeah so
 

2797
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,829
are going to be pure functions yeah so
now we need an effect system right to

2798
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:33,839
now we need an effect system right to
 

2799
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,430
now we need an effect system right to
ensure that to um so that we can check

2800
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:37,440
ensure that to um so that we can check
 

2801
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,630
ensure that to um so that we can check
that um uh types are pure functions and

2802
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
that um uh types are pure functions and
 

2803
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,140
that um uh types are pure functions and
indeed verse has an effect system

2804
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:43,150
indeed verse has an effect system
 

2805
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,349
indeed verse has an effect system
[Laughter]

2806
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:45,359
[Laughter]
 

2807
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,349
[Laughter]
too so you can see why it gets

2808
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:47,359
too so you can see why it gets
 

2809
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,069
too so you can see why it gets
complicated yeah yeah where are you on

2810
00:56:51,069 --> 00:56:51,079
complicated yeah yeah where are you on
 

2811
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,309
complicated yeah yeah where are you on
um formalizing the effect system and are

2812
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:53,319
um formalizing the effect system and are
 

2813
00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:56,270
um formalizing the effect system and are

crudely put that's not very hard right

2866
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:04,440
crudely put that's not very hard right
 

2867
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,029
crudely put that's not very hard right
is this expression pure well does it use

2868
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:06,039
is this expression pure well does it use
 

2869
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:07,430
is this expression pure well does it use
any side effects

2870

any side effects
 

2871
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,309
any side effects
directly and does it cause any call any

2872
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:10,319
directly and does it cause any call any

functions that can use side effects yeah

2874
00:58:13,029 --> 00:58:13,039
functions that can use side effects yeah
 

2875
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:15,029
functions that can use side effects yeah
right so at its crudest level you can

2876
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:15,039
right so at its crudest level you can
 

2877
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,950
right so at its crudest level you can
see there must be some kind of Purity

2878
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:18,960
see there must be some kind of Purity
 

2879
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,829
see there must be some kind of Purity

Checker that isn't very
 

2881
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,910
Checker that isn't very
hard yes right but to do a systematic

2882
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:23,920
hard yes right but to do a systematic
 

2883
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,630
hard yes right but to do a systematic
job of an effective system is indeed um

2884
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:26,640
job of an effective system is indeed um
 

2885
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,470
job of an effective system is indeed um
quite a challenge and that's part of

00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
quite a challenge and that's part of
 

2887
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,390
quite a challenge and that's part of
what we're up to at the moment yes

2888
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
what we're up to at the moment yes
 

2889
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,950
what we're up to at the moment yes
um I should say by the way um that Tim

2890
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:35,960
um I should say by the way um that Tim
 

2891
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,829
um I should say by the way um that Tim
has an implementation of all of this um

2892
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:39,839
has an implementation of all of this um
 

2893
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,870
has an implementation of all of this um
embedded in you know his his C++

2894
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:42,880
embedded in you know his his C++

2899
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:49,950
C++ a compiler he's been developing over
the last 20 years and it's it's only

2900
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:49,960
the last 20 years and it's it's only
 

2901
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,829
the last 20 years and it's it's only
five or 10,000 lines of C++ it's

2902
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:51,839
five or 10,000 lines of C++ it's
 

2903
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,829
five or 10,000 lines of C++ it's
incredibly small he is a virtuoso C++

00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:54,839
incredibly small he is a virtuoso C++
 

2905
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:58,789
incredibly small he is a virtuoso C++
going um but uh um but I think he would

2906
00:58:58,789 --> 00:58:58,799
going um but uh um but I think he would
 

2907
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,589
going um but uh um but I think he would
be the first to admit that it's um you

2908
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:01,599
be the first to admit that it's um you
 

2909
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,549
be the first to admit that it's um you
know it makes an amazingly good stab at

2910
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:04,559
know it makes an amazingly good stab at
 

2911
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,710
know it makes an amazingly good stab at
all of this but it is not uh you know uh

2912
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:07,720
all of this but it is not uh you know uh
 

2913
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,549
all of this but it is not uh you know uh
tight and elegant and complete and

2914
00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:09,559
tight and elegant and complete and
 

2915
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:12,029
tight and elegant and complete and
definitely right um in every particular

2916
00:59:12,029 --> 00:59:12,039
definitely right um in every particular
 

2917
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:14,870
definitely right um in every particular
so it's an excellent stab and it means

2918
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880
so it's an excellent stab and it means
 

2919
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,510
so it's an excellent stab and it means
that we have it's it's a way that he has

2920
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:16,520
that we have it's it's a way that he has
 

2921
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,349
that we have it's it's a way that he has
been using to educate his intuitions to

2922
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:18,359
been using to educate his intuitions to
 

2923
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:19,750
been using to educate his intuitions to
go back to your questions about

2924
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:19,760
go back to your questions about
 

2925
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,309
go back to your questions about
computers keeping you honest I think

2926
00:59:21,309 --> 00:59:21,319
computers keeping you honest I think
 

2927
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:24,109
computers keeping you honest I think
building that has indeed educated his

2931
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,190

throughout right but where as it were

00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:28,200
throughout right but where as it were
 

2933
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,670
throughout right but where as it were
we're not building directly on that

2934
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:29,680
we're not building directly on that
 

2935
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,910
we're not building directly on that
we're trying to use that as a source of

2936
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:30,920
we're trying to use that as a source of
 

2937
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,069
we're trying to use that as a source of
inspiration to do this more foundational

2938
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:33,079
inspiration to do this more foundational
 

2939
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:36,069
inspiration to do this more foundational
thing that we're talking about yeah and

2940
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:36,079
thing that we're talking about yeah and
 

2941
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,750
thing that we're talking about yeah and
that presumably is going to occupy you

2942
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:37,760
that presumably is going to occupy you
 

2943
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,349
that presumably is going to occupy you
for a good few years to come um I think

2944
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:40,359
for a good few years to come um I think
 

2945
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:43,309
for a good few years to come um I think
so though in some the the the um the

2946
00:59:43,309 --> 00:59:43,319
so though in some the the the um the
 

2947
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:45,710
so though in some the the the um the
scary bit is that we are designing the

2948
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:45,720
scary bit is that we are designing the
 

2949
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,470
scary bit is that we are designing the
airplane at the same moment as we're

2950
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:47,480
airplane at the same moment as we're
 

2951
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,870
airplane at the same moment as we're
launching it into the

2952
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:48,880
launching it into the
 

2953
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,829
launching it into the
sky right

2954
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:50,839

2955
00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:54,150

01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:04,760
yeah it is a um it doesn't have any of
 

2965
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,789
yeah it is a um it doesn't have any of
this functional logic stuff in it but it

01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,549
this functional logic stuff in it but it
does have other things like classes

2968
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:08,559
does have other things like classes
 

2969
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,390
does have other things like classes
inheritance and modules um so it's a so

2970
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
inheritance and modules um so it's a so
 

2971
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,870
inheritance and modules um so it's a so
it's a language that um uh is already

2972
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:14,880
it's a language that um uh is already
 

2973
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,870
it's a language that um uh is already
usable for building you know games and

2974
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:17,880
usable for building you know games and
 

2975
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,390
usable for building you know games and
um creative stuff in the sort of

2976
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
um creative stuff in the sort of
 

2977
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,789
um creative stuff in the sort of
fortnite Universe um and programming

2978
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:22,799
fortnite Universe um and programming
 

2979
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,910
fortnite Universe um and programming
gets unreal so it's already being Us by

2980
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:24,920
gets unreal so it's already being Us by
 

2981
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,710
gets unreal so it's already being Us by
thousands of people so we're doing this

2982
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:26,720
thousands of people so we're doing this
 

2983
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,390
thousands of people so we're doing this
foundational thing on the side and then

2984
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:29,400
foundational thing on the side and then
 

2985
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,109
foundational thing on the side and then
so we sort of launched one to mix

2986
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
so we sort of launched one to mix
 

2987
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,670
so we sort of launched one to mix
metaphors we launched one rocket you

2988
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:32,680
metaphors we launched one rocket you
 

2989
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,549
metaphors we launched one rocket you
know into orbit and now we're you know

2990
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:34,559
know into orbit and now we're you know
 

2991
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,349
know into orbit and now we're you know
building some more elaborate and

2992
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:36,359
building some more elaborate and
 

2993
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:37,309
building some more elaborate and
sophisticated thing we're going to

2994
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:37,319
sophisticated thing we're going to
 

2995
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:38,510
sophisticated thing we're going to
launch into orbit then they're going to

2996
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:38,520
launch into orbit then they're going to
 

2997
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,069
launch into orbit then they're going to
join up in the sky and

2998
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:42,079
join up in the sky and
 

2999
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,430
join up in the sky and
hopefully we we will um so so the scary

3000
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
hopefully we we will um so so the scary
 

3001
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,950
hopefully we we will um so so the scary
bit is we need to do that quickly enough

3002
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:47,960
bit is we need to do that quickly enough
 

3003
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,710
bit is we need to do that quickly enough
um that you we can't go on for years and

3004
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
um that you we can't go on for years and
 

3005
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,230
um that you we can't go on for years and
years and years doing this foundational

3006
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
years and years doing this foundational
 

3007
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,510
years and years doing this foundational
stuff because um you know the the the

3008
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:54,520
stuff because um you know the the the
 

3009
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,910
stuff because um you know the the the
airplanes flying in the sky we want to

3010
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:55,920
airplanes flying in the sky we want to
 

3011
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,309
airplanes flying in the sky we want to
we want to meet up sooner you know

3012
01:00:57,309 --> 01:00:57,319
we want to meet up sooner you know
 

3013
01:00:57,319 --> 01:00:59,430
we want to meet up sooner you know
within a year or two rather than in 10

3014
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,440
within a year or two rather than in 10
 

3015
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,789
within a year or two rather than in 10
years so right yes I think working out

3016
01:01:01,789 --> 01:01:01,799
years so right yes I think working out
 

3017
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:03,270
years so right yes I think working out
all these technical details and writing

3018
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:03,280
all these technical details and writing
 

3019
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,789
all these technical details and writing
papers about them will occupy us for

3020
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:04,799
papers about them will occupy us for
 

3021
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,349
papers about them will occupy us for
several years um but there is a pretty

3022
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
several years um but there is a pretty
 

3023
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,190
several years um but there is a pretty
big urgency at the same time that I

3024
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:09,200
big urgency at the same time that I
 

3025
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,910
big urgency at the same time that I
personally find a bit

3026
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:10,920
personally find a bit
 

3027
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,470
personally find a bit
scary I can understand that and do you

3028
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:14,480
scary I can understand that and do you
 

3029
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,470
scary I can understand that and do you
one last question then do you think

3030
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:17,480
one last question then do you think
 

3031
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,549
one last question then do you think
that do you think that these ideas will

3032
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:20,559
that do you think that these ideas will
 

3033
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,990
that do you think that these ideas will
be pinned particularly to verse or they

3034
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
be pinned particularly to verse or they
 

3035
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,910
be pinned particularly to verse or they
juicy things that other language

3036
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
juicy things that other language
 

3037
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,630
juicy things that other language
designers can pull out of this and steal

3038
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:28,640
designers can pull out of this and steal
 

3039
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,910
designers can pull out of this and steal
oh well um I mean the one of the whole

any particular language implementation

3046
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:39,440
any particular language implementation
 

3047
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,309
any particular language implementation
will be

3048
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:40,319
will be
 

3049
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,190
will be
encrusted with particulars right hascal

encrusted with particulars right hascal
is no exception by the way it's an

3052
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:44,520
is no exception by the way it's an
 

3053
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,510
is no exception by the way it's an
enormous language and with a lot of

3054
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:46,520
enormous language and with a lot of
 

3055
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,230
enormous language and with a lot of
detail to it and you need to get to know

3056
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
detail to it and you need to get to know
 

3057
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,589

it's ecosystem and cabal and stack and

3058
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:51,599
it's ecosystem and cabal and stack and
 

3059
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,069
it's ecosystem and cabal and stack and
um hls and on and on right so and vers

01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:55,079
um hls and on and on right so and vers
 

3061

will similarly be encrusted with lots of

3062
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:56,920
will similarly be encrusted with lots of
 

3063
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,069
will similarly be encrusted with lots of
stuff but if we want to um you know the

3064
01:02:01,069 --> 01:02:01,079
stuff but if we want to um you know the
 

3065
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:03,109
stuff but if we want to um you know the
purposes of of the purpose

3066
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:03,119
purposes of of the purpose
 

3067
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,589
purposes of of the purpose
of uh sort of the research um Enterprise

3068
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:07,599
of uh sort of the research um Enterprise
 

3069
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,990
of uh sort of the research um Enterprise
is to isolate the key ideas and distill

3070
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:12,000
is to isolate the key ideas and distill
 

3071
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,430
is to isolate the key ideas and distill
them into a form that they can be

3072
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
them into a form that they can be
 

3073
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,950
them into a form that they can be
digested by other other language

3074
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:14,960
digested by other other language
 

3075
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,589
digested by other other language
designers and academics right right and

3076
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599
designers and academics right right and
 

3077
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,470
designers and academics right right and
so indeed it is my goal um that um our

3078
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:21,480
so indeed it is my goal um that um our
 

3079
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,789
so indeed it is my goal um that um our
you know our first paper and hopefully

3080
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:22,799
you know our first paper and hopefully
 

3081
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:25,109
you know our first paper and hopefully
subsequent papers about um verse and the

3082
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:25,119
subsequent papers about um verse and the
 

3083
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,470
subsequent papers about um verse and the
verse calculus will be influential well

3084
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
verse calculus will be influential well
 

3085
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,390
verse calculus will be influential well
you know will be much more than just

3086
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:30,400
you know will be much more than just
 

3087
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,710
you know will be much more than just
saying well this is how verse works

3088
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:32,720
saying well this is how verse works
 

3089
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,789
saying well this is how verse works
right will but they will rather embody

3090
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
right will but they will rather embody
 

3091
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,710
right will but they will rather embody
and and make precise a collection of

3092
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:39,720
and and make precise a collection of
 

3093
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,750
and and make precise a collection of
ideas that may you know I hope who knows

3094
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760
ideas that may you know I hope who knows
 

3095
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,829
ideas that may you know I hope who knows
um have be influential in their own

3096
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:45,839
um have be influential in their own
 

3097
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,750
um have be influential in their own
right yeah yeah as a language research

3098
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:48,760
right yeah yeah as a language research
 

3099
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,109
right yeah yeah as a language research
your um your goal is to make the ideas

3100
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
your um your goal is to make the ideas
 

3101
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,829
your um your goal is to make the ideas
bigger than any one language Oh indeed

3102
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:53,839
bigger than any one language Oh indeed
 

3103
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,670
bigger than any one language Oh indeed
yeah indeed I often when when talking to

3104
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:56,680
yeah indeed I often when when talking to
 

3105
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,150
yeah indeed I often when when talking to
um research students about writing

3106
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,160
um research students about writing
 

3107
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,029
um research students about writing
papers I often say that you know that

3108
01:03:00,029 --> 01:03:00,039
papers I often say that you know that
 

3109
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:03,349
papers I often say that you know that
the the the the uh the least durable

3110
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:03,359
the the the the uh the least durable
 

3111
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,430
the the the the uh the least durable
thing that we do is to build artifacts

3112
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:05,440
thing that we do is to build artifacts
 

3113
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,470
thing that we do is to build artifacts
you know like compilers in my case um

3114
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:08,480
you know like compilers in my case um
 

3115
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,470
you know like compilers in my case um
the most durable thing we do is write

3116
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
the most durable thing we do is write
 

3117
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,109
the most durable thing we do is write
papers right because those papers will

3118
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:13,119
papers right because those papers will
 

3119
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,829
papers right because those papers will
be um you know in in the best case will

3120
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:15,839
be um you know in in the best case will
 

3121
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,990
be um you know in in the best case will
be uh read and will inform stuff uh

3122
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:19,000
be uh read and will inform stuff uh
 

3123
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,670
be uh read and will inform stuff uh
decades later when you know when the the

3124
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:20,680
decades later when you know when the the
 

3125
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,069
decades later when you know when the the
particular language implementation is

3126
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
particular language implementation is
 

3127
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,670
particular language implementation is
dust I mean just look at the fact that

3128
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:23,680
dust I mean just look at the fact that
 

3129
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,789
dust I mean just look at the fact that
we're still you know Alonzo Church's

3130
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:25,799
we're still you know Alonzo Church's
 

3131
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,710
we're still you know Alonzo Church's
ideas we are talking about in the

3132
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:27,720
ideas we are talking about in the
 

3133
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,549
ideas we are talking about in the
podcast today which is you know a

3134
01:03:29,549 --> 01:03:29,559
podcast today which is you know a
 

3135
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:31,269
podcast today which is you know a
hundred years since he was first

3136
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:31,279
hundred years since he was first
 

3137
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:33,150
hundred years since he was first
thinking about them that's amazing yeah

3138
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:33,160
thinking about them that's amazing yeah
 

3139
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,230
thinking about them that's amazing yeah
yeah when we go to a concert hall we

3140
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:35,240
yeah when we go to a concert hall we
 

3141
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,789
yeah when we go to a concert hall we
listen to people reading Mozart's papers

3142
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:37,799
listen to people reading Mozart's papers
 

3143
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:39,829
listen to people reading Mozart's papers
he called them Symphonies but they are

3144
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
he called them Symphonies but they are
 

3145
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,950
he called them Symphonies but they are
you know his you know intellectually

3146
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:41,960
you know his you know intellectually
 

3147
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,589
you know his you know intellectually
written down stuff and uh symphony

3148
01:03:44,589 --> 01:03:44,599
written down stuff and uh symphony
 

3149
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:46,630
written down stuff and uh symphony
orchestras read them of course there's a

3150
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,640
orchestras read them of course there's a
 

3151
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,029
orchestras read them of course there's a
great deal of expressiveness and Nuance

3152
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
great deal of expressiveness and Nuance
 

3153
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,190
great deal of expressiveness and Nuance
of what they do but the fact is that

3154
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:52,200
of what they do but the fact is that
 

3155
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,309
of what they do but the fact is that
mozar infected our brains with an idea

3156
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:55,319
mozar infected our brains with an idea
 

3157
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:58,829
mozar infected our brains with an idea
that we still find rewarding um yeah and

3158
01:03:58,829 --> 01:03:58,839
that we still find rewarding um yeah and
 

3159
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,870
that we still find rewarding um yeah and
I think the the um you know the purpose

3160
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:00,880
I think the the um you know the purpose
 

3161
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,269
I think the the um you know the purpose
of uh uh research papers in some ways is

3162
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:04,279
of uh uh research papers in some ways is
 

3163
01:04:04,279 --> 01:04:06,950
of uh uh research papers in some ways is
is to infect the brain of the reader

3164
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
is to infect the brain of the reader
 

3165
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,670
is to infect the brain of the reader
with a an idea that is so persuasive and

3166
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:09,680
with a an idea that is so persuasive and
 

3167
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,670
with a an idea that is so persuasive and
seductive and exciting and creative and

3168
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:11,680
seductive and exciting and creative and
 

3169
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,029
seductive and exciting and creative and
interesting that they can then use it to

3170
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:14,039
interesting that they can then use it to
 

3171
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:15,670
interesting that they can then use it to
inspire and build on new things that's

3172
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:15,680
inspire and build on new things that's
 

3173
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,190
inspire and build on new things that's
the that's that's that's my hope yeah

3174
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:18,200
the that's that's that's my hope yeah
 

3175
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,549
the that's that's that's my hope yeah
yeah we had um we had a guest a couple

3176
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:20,559
yeah we had um we had a guest a couple
 

3177
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,390
yeah we had um we had a guest a couple
of weeks ago who was um hoping to build

3178
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:23,400
of weeks ago who was um hoping to build
 

3179
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,549
of weeks ago who was um hoping to build
a version of that would last 100

3180
01:04:26,549 --> 01:04:26,559
a version of that would last 100
 

3181
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:31,269
a version of that would last 100
years but I and I I I um I certainly

3182
01:04:31,269 --> 01:04:31,279
years but I and I I I um I certainly
 

3183
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:32,789
years but I and I I I um I certainly
hope he succeeds but what I can

3184
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:32,799
hope he succeeds but what I can
 

3185
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,510
hope he succeeds but what I can
definitely see as some of the ideas

3186
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:34,520
definitely see as some of the ideas
 

3187
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,670
definitely see as some of the ideas
you've been percolating up still being

3188
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:36,680
you've been percolating up still being
 

3189
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,470
you've been percolating up still being
discussed a 100 years from now and

3190
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
discussed a 100 years from now and
 

3191
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,349
discussed a 100 years from now and
inspiring new languages yeah I think

3192
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:40,359
inspiring new languages yeah I think
 

3193
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:42,829
inspiring new languages yeah I think
it's I think yes languages are surpr can

3194
01:04:42,829 --> 01:04:42,839
it's I think yes languages are surpr can
 

3195
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:43,910
it's I think yes languages are surpr can
programming languages actually are an

3196
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:43,920
programming languages actually are an
 

3197
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,870
programming languages actually are an
example of something that can be

3198
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:44,880
example of something that can be
 

3199
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,510
example of something that can be
surprisingly long lived like Cobalt is

3200
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:46,520
surprisingly long lived like Cobalt is
 

3201
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,390
surprisingly long lived like Cobalt is
still alive and well yeah but not in a

3202
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:49,400
still alive and well yeah but not in a
 

3203
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:54,910
still alive and well yeah but not in a
good way um I think right so um

3204
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:54,920
good way um I think right so um
 

3205
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,510
good way um I think right so um
you know it's not it's not Cobalt is no

3206
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:56,520
you know it's not it's not Cobalt is no
 

3207
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,190
you know it's not it's not Cobalt is no
longer a source of inspiring ideas just

3208
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,200
longer a source of inspiring ideas just
 

3209
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,470
longer a source of inspiring ideas just
that we have so much code written in it

3210
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:00,480
that we have so much code written in it
 

3211
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,309
that we have so much code written in it
we have to still you know run those

3212
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
we have to still you know run those
 

3213
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,430
we have to still you know run those
compilers um yeah so I suspect that if

3214
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:05,440
compilers um yeah so I suspect that if
 

3215
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,670
compilers um yeah so I suspect that if
um you know hcol is still around in 100

3216
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
um you know hcol is still around in 100
 

3217
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,349
um you know hcol is still around in 100
years it would be not in a good way

3218
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:09,359
years it would be not in a good way
 

3219
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,829
years it would be not in a good way
right whereas I hope the ideas might be

3220
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:11,839
right whereas I hope the ideas might be
 

3221
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,109
right whereas I hope the ideas might be
you know visibly embodied in some more

3222
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:14,119
you know visibly embodied in some more
 

3223
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,549
you know visibly embodied in some more
wonderful thing that we have worked out

3224
01:05:15,549 --> 01:05:15,559
wonderful thing that we have worked out
 

3225
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:17,870
wonderful thing that we have worked out
by then yeah yeah you'd hope that the

3226
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:17,880
by then yeah yeah you'd hope that the
 

3227
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,190
by then yeah yeah you'd hope that the
ideas there are fundamental enough that

3228
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:20,200
ideas there are fundamental enough that
 

3229
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,430
ideas there are fundamental enough that
they'll outlive the programs and us

3230
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:23,440
they'll outlive the programs and us
 

3231
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,950
they'll outlive the programs and us
right which actually leads me to the

3232
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:25,960
right which actually leads me to the
 

3233
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,309
right which actually leads me to the
other Big Arm of your work which is

3234
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:28,319
other Big Arm of your work which is
 

3235
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,390
other Big Arm of your work which is
passing the Big Ideas On to the Next

3236
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:30,400
passing the Big Ideas On to the Next
 

3237
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,349
passing the Big Ideas On to the Next
Generation tell me about that yeah um

3238
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:34,359
Generation tell me about that yeah um
 

3239
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:36,269
Generation tell me about that yeah um
Computing education super important and

3240
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:36,279
Computing education super important and
 

3241
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:39,029
Computing education super important and
a bit and we I think we as a you know as

3242
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:39,039
a bit and we I think we as a you know as
 

3243
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,789
a bit and we I think we as a you know as
a what's the word as a professional

3244
01:05:41,789 --> 01:05:41,799
a what's the word as a professional
 

3245
01:05:41,799 --> 01:05:45,230
a what's the word as a professional
Community um we owe it to not to our

3246
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:45,240
Community um we owe it to not to our
 

3247
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,670
Community um we owe it to not to our
discipline in particular to our children

3248
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:47,680
discipline in particular to our children
 

3249
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,230
discipline in particular to our children
to be thoughtful

3250
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,240
to be thoughtful
 

3251
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,870
to be thoughtful
about what are you know what should our

3252
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:52,880
about what are you know what should our
 

3253
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,190
about what are you know what should our
children be learning about our

3254
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:54,200
children be learning about our
 

3255
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,589
children be learning about our
discipline um and um in a in a way that

3256
01:05:58,589 --> 01:05:58,599
discipline um and um in a in a way that
 

3257
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:00,870
discipline um and um in a in a way that
would make them you know empowered

3258
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:00,880
would make them you know empowered
 

3259
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,430
would make them you know empowered
citizens and uh ones who think it's just

3260
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,440
citizens and uh ones who think it's just
 

3261
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,069
citizens and uh ones who think it's just
the most exciting thing since life bread

3262
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:05,079
the most exciting thing since life bread
 

3263
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:09,190
the most exciting thing since life bread
which it is um and let's not put up with

3264
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:09,200
which it is um and let's not put up with
 

3265
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,910
which it is um and let's not put up with
uh an education that sort of substandard

3266
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:10,920
uh an education that sort of substandard
 

3267
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,910
uh an education that sort of substandard
in that respect which is

3268
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:12,920
in that respect which is
 

3269
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,029
in that respect which is
um so so I think it's there's an

3270
01:06:16,029 --> 01:06:16,039
um so so I think it's there's an
 

3271
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,349
um so so I think it's there's an
Endeavor that we should all be involved

3272
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:17,359
Endeavor that we should all be involved
 

3273
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,029
Endeavor that we should all be involved
in in some way where would you go with

3274
01:06:20,029 --> 01:06:20,039
in in some way where would you go with
 

3275

too much Excel and
 

3283
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,910
too much Excel and
PowerPoint yes well it's probably a bit

3284
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:32,920
PowerPoint yes well it's probably a bit
 

3285
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,430
PowerPoint yes well it's probably a bit
better than it was right so um when we

3286
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:35,440
better than it was right so um when we
 

3287
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,870
better than it was right so um when we
started Computing at school C the um

3292
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:42,760
lot of changes in the curriculum um the
 

3293
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,910
lot of changes in the curriculum um the
the national curriculum said you should

they can think critically yeah and but
 

3367
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,510
they can think critically yeah and but
it's not just it it's a bit more than

it's not just it it's a bit more than
 

3369
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,030
it's not just it it's a bit more than
just think critically they also need a

work which is good when it's controlling
the plane that's about to land you yes

3434
01:09:36,669 --> 01:09:36,679
the plane that's about to land you yes
 

3435
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:39,149
the plane that's about to land you yes
um so um but so I think just as you need

3436
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:39,159
um so um but so I think just as you need
 

3437
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:40,910
um so um but so I think just as you need
to I think all children should learn

3438
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:40,920
to I think all children should learn
 

3439
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,070
to I think all children should learn
some some Elementary aspects of Natural

3440
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:43,080
some some Elementary aspects of Natural
 

3441
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,110
some some Elementary aspects of Natural
Science I think they should learn

3442
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:44,120
Science I think they should learn
 

3443
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,070
Science I think they should learn
Elementary aspects of computer science

3444
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,080
Elementary aspects of computer science
 

3445
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,870
Elementary aspects of computer science
so that they're in a position they have

3446
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:47,880
so that they're in a position they have
 

3447
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,510
so that they're in a position they have
enough knowledge base as well as um

3448
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:50,520
enough knowledge base as well as um
 

3449
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,829
enough knowledge base as well as um
logical thinking and skills to make

3450
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:52,839
logical thinking and skills to make
 

3451
01:09:52,839 --> 01:09:55,110
logical thinking and skills to make
well-informed choices about um the

3452
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,120
well-informed choices about um the
 

3453
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,149
well-informed choices about um the
digital world that surrounds them so

3454
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:57,159
digital world that surrounds them so
 

3455
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,550
digital world that surrounds them so
pressingly and

3456
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,560
pressingly and
 

3457
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,870
pressingly and
intimately and practically for you is

3458
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,880
intimately and practically for you is
 

3459
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,229
intimately and practically for you is
that influencing the curriculum at the

3460
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:03,239
that influencing the curriculum at the
 

3461
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:05,550
that influencing the curriculum at the
national level yeah absolutely it is I

3462
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:05,560
national level yeah absolutely it is I
 

3463
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,630
national level yeah absolutely it is I
mean as I say it's completely

3464
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:06,640
mean as I say it's completely
 

3465
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,990
mean as I say it's completely
transformed before it said you should

3466
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:09,000
transformed before it said you should
 

3467
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,550
transformed before it said you should
learn about digital technology now it

3468
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,560
learn about digital technology now it
 

3469
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,470
learn about digital technology now it
says all children should learn the

3470
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:13,480
says all children should learn the
 

3471
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,870
says all children should learn the
fundamental principles of computer

3472
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
fundamental principles of computer
 

3473
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,110
fundamental principles of computer
science which is a huge challenge for

3474
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,120
science which is a huge challenge for
 

3475
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,430
science which is a huge challenge for
schools if you're a primary teacher you

3476
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
schools if you're a primary teacher you
 

3477
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,189
schools if you're a primary teacher you
might you might think computer sign I

3478
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:21,199
might you might think computer sign I
 

3479
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,470
might you might think computer sign I
mean at the time it was put in the

3480
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:22,480
mean at the time it was put in the
 

3481
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,910
mean at the time it was put in the
National curriculum you know we were not

3482
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:24,920
National curriculum you know we were not
 

3483
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,630
National curriculum you know we were not
long past the time when people thought

3484
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:26,640
long past the time when people thought
 

3485
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,750
long past the time when people thought
well computer science that's just a

3486
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
well computer science that's just a
 

3487
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,430
well computer science that's just a
university course isn't it yeah and then

3488
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:30,440
university course isn't it yeah and then
 

3489
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,950
university course isn't it yeah and then
suddenly we say oh no primary school

3490
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
suddenly we say oh no primary school
 

3491
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,070
suddenly we say oh no primary school
children should have some Elementary

3492
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,080
children should have some Elementary
 

3493
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,189
children should have some Elementary
understanding in the same way that have

3494
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:37,199
understanding in the same way that have
 

3495
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,510
understanding in the same way that have
you know their understanding of physics

3496
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:38,520
you know their understanding of physics
 

3497
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,470
you know their understanding of physics
is not very deep or biology right but

3498
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:41,480
is not very deep or biology right but
 

3499
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,070
is not very deep or biology right but
they but a primary school teacher sees

3500
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:44,080
they but a primary school teacher sees
 

3501
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,870
they but a primary school teacher sees
themselves as you know part of their

3502
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:45,880
themselves as you know part of their
 

3503
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,669
themselves as you know part of their
task is to give an elementary

3504
01:10:48,669 --> 01:10:48,679
task is to give an elementary
 

3505
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,030
task is to give an elementary
understanding of Natural Science and so

3506
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:50,040
understanding of Natural Science and so
 

3507
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,669
understanding of Natural Science and so
so it's a big challenge there because um

3508
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:52,679
so it's a big challenge there because um
 

3509
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:56,870
so it's a big challenge there because um
we uh uh it's easy enough to say uh

3510
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
we uh uh it's easy enough to say uh
 

3511
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,270
we uh uh it's easy enough to say uh
children should get an elementary

3512
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:58,280
children should get an elementary
 

3513
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,430
children should get an elementary
understanding of the principles of

3514
01:10:59,430 --> 01:10:59,440
understanding of the principles of
 

3515
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,430
understanding of the principles of
computer science and should have

3516
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:00,440
computer science and should have
 

3517
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,630
computer science and should have
practical experience of writing programs

3518
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:02,640
practical experience of writing programs
 

3519
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,910
practical experience of writing programs
um because that's that's like the lab

3520
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:04,920
um because that's that's like the lab
 

3521
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,790
um because that's that's like the lab
work of the subject if you like it's

3522
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:07,800
work of the subject if you like it's
 

3523
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,470
work of the subject if you like it's
yeah programming is to computer science

3524
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:09,480
yeah programming is to computer science
 

3525
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,070
yeah programming is to computer science
as lab work is to physics you know it's

3526
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:11,080
as lab work is to physics you know it's
 

3527
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,669
as lab work is to physics you know it's
really important um yeah it's easy

3528
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:13,679
really important um yeah it's easy
 

3529
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,510
really important um yeah it's easy
enough to say that but to turn it into a

3530
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:15,520
enough to say that but to turn it into a
 

3531
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,229
enough to say that but to turn it into a
practical reality you've got to say well

3532
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:17,239
practical reality you've got to say well
 

3533
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,790
practical reality you've got to say well
okay so specifically what should

3534
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:18,800
okay so specifically what should
 

3535
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,229
okay so specifically what should
children learn at primary school and how

3536
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:21,239
children learn at primary school and how
 

3537
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:22,709
children learn at primary school and how
should they learn it in what order

3538
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:22,719
should they learn it in what order
 

3539
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:25,110
should they learn it in what order
should they learn the concept cepts um

3540
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,120
should they learn the concept cepts um
 

3541
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,229
should they learn the concept cepts um
and and all and then you know even once

3542
01:11:27,229 --> 01:11:27,239
and and all and then you know even once
 

3543
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:28,870
and and all and then you know even once
you got that all laid out you got then

3544
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:28,880
you got that all laid out you got then
 

3545
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,709
you got that all laid out you got then
got to say and how can we train teachers

3546
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:30,719
got to say and how can we train teachers
 

3547
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,030
got to say and how can we train teachers
to be good at doing that right um same

3548
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:34,040
to be good at doing that right um same
 

3549
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,270
to be good at doing that right um same
at Secondary School seems like one of

3550
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,280
at Secondary School seems like one of
 

3551
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,990
at Secondary School seems like one of
the hardest tasks yeah so so it is so

3552
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:38,000
the hardest tasks yeah so so it is so
 

3553
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,910
the hardest tasks yeah so so it is so
the you know that ever since 200 this

3554
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:40,920
the you know that ever since 200 this
 

3555
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,070
the you know that ever since 200 this
became part of the national curriculum

3556
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:42,080
became part of the national curriculum
 

3557

3600
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:35,880
2018 I became its first chair oh wow
 

3601
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,149
2018 I became its first chair oh wow
it's all it's all and it's on its second

3602
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:38,159
it's all it's all and it's on its second
 

3603
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,629
it's all it's all and it's on its second
iteration now and I hope that there will

3604
01:12:39,629 --> 01:12:39,639
iteration now and I hope that there will
 

3605
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:40,750
iteration now and I hope that there will
be a

3613
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:51,550
say job done and not at all to say job
done because um it's a big job right to

um we are far from the the the place in
 

3617
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,390
um we are far from the the the place in
which every child gets a great Computing

3618
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
which every child gets a great Computing

the audience for this podcast might I

3622
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:04,360
the audience for this podcast might I
 

3623
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,910
the audience for this podcast might I
would like to say might be interested

3624
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:06,920
would like to say might be interested
 

3625
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,430
would like to say might be interested
but and I and I would I would like to

3626
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:08,440
but and I and I would I would like to
 

3627
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,070
but and I and I would I would like to
say should be interested is that I think

3628
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:11,080
say should be interested is that I think
 

3629
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,430
say should be interested is that I think
this task the one that I've just

3630
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:12,440
this task the one that I've just
 

3631
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,110
this task the one that I've just
described about saying what should we

3632
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:14,120
described about saying what should we
 

3633
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,390
described about saying what should we
teach exactly you know when and how um

3634
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:17,400
teach exactly you know when and how um
 

3635
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,270
teach exactly you know when and how um
and with what materials um all of that

3636
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:20,280
and with what materials um all of that
 

3637
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,790
and with what materials um all of that
is too important um to and too just to

3638
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:23,800
is too important um to and too just to
 

3639
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,750
is too important um to and too just to
leave to school teachers to make up for

3640
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:25,760
leave to school teachers to make up for
 

3641
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,390
leave to school teachers to make up for
themselves or even from some even if

3642
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:28,400
themselves or even from some even if
 

3643
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,870

national Center of Community Education I

3646
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:31,600
national Center of Community Education I
 

3647
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,709
national Center of Community Education I
think we as a technical community should

3648
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:34,719
think we as a technical community should
 

3649
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,270
think we as a technical community should
be involved as individuals and our

3650
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
be involved as individuals and our
 

3651
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,390
be involved as individuals and our
companies should be kind of

3652
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,400
companies should be kind of
 

3653
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,430
companies should be kind of
institutionally involved in trying to

3654
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:40,440
institutionally involved in trying to
 

3655
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,590
institutionally involved in trying to
make Computing education into just great

3656
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
make Computing education into just great
 

3657
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,910
make Computing education into just great
across the whole country in every

3658
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:45,920
across the whole country in every
 

3659
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,189
across the whole country in every
classroom okay so I would understand if

3660
01:13:50,189 --> 01:13:50,199
classroom okay so I would understand if
 

3661
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:51,229
classroom okay so I would understand if
I want

01:13:51,229 --> 01:13:51,239
I want
 

3663
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:54,510
I want
to if I want to move verse forward in

to if I want to move verse forward in
 

3665
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,110
to if I want to move verse forward in
some way I would go and download it

3666
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
some way I would go and download it
 

3667
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,709
some way I would go and download it
write some code in it or download the

3668
01:13:58,709 --> 01:13:58,719
write some code in it or download the
 

3669
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:00,709
write some code in it or download the
paper and try implementing it yeah how

3670
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
paper and try implementing it yeah how
 

3671
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,070
paper and try implementing it yeah how
do I I have no idea how I would get

3672
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:03,080
do I I have no idea how I would get
 

3673
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,950
do I I have no idea how I would get
involved in moving the

3674
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:04,960
involved in moving the
 

3675
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,870
involved in moving the
education of children in Computing

3676
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:08,880
education of children in Computing
 

3677
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,070
education of children in Computing
forward in the way you're describing how

3678
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:11,080
forward in the way you're describing how
 

3679
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,470
forward in the way you're describing how
would someone get started in that

3680
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:12,480
would someone get started in that
 

3681
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:17,149
would someone get started in that
project yeah um so the uh uh I can give

3682
01:14:17,149 --> 01:14:17,159
project yeah um so the uh uh I can give
 

3683
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:20,910
project yeah um so the uh uh I can give
you the first step is join Cass right um

3684
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:20,920
you the first step is join Cass right um
 

3685
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,830
you the first step is join Cass right um
Computing at school um K it's

3686
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:23,840
Computing at school um K it's
 

3687
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,950
Computing at school um K it's
many of the members of Kaza teachers but

3688
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:25,960
many of the members of Kaza teachers but
 

3689
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,629
many of the members of Kaza teachers but
um there's also you know a third to a

3690
01:14:28,629 --> 01:14:28,639
um there's also you know a third to a
 

3691
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:30,950
um there's also you know a third to a
half our it Professionals of one kind

3692
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
half our it Professionals of one kind
 

3693
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,310
half our it Professionals of one kind
okay and then there are various sort of

3694
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:33,320
okay and then there are various sort of
 

3695
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,830
okay and then there are various sort of
thematic interest groups there's one on

3696
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:34,840
thematic interest groups there's one on
 

3697
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,310
thematic interest groups there's one on
AI and there's one on primary that you

3698
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,320
AI and there's one on primary that you
 

3699
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,070
AI and there's one on primary that you
could um join um and

3700
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:40,080
could um join um and
 

3701
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,470
could um join um and
um uh so joining CM go to the C National

3702
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:45,480
um uh so joining CM go to the C National
 

3703
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,830
um uh so joining CM go to the C National
Conference just becoming better informed

3704
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:46,840
Conference just becoming better informed
 

3705
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,030
Conference just becoming better informed
about it there probably a um a cast

3706
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:50,040
about it there probably a um a cast
 

3707
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,550
about it there probably a um a cast
local community a sort of physical

3708
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:51,560
local community a sort of physical
 

3709
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,350
local community a sort of physical
getting together of teachers in your

3710
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:53,360
getting together of teachers in your
 

3711
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,629
getting together of teachers in your
area so going to one of those would mean

3712
01:14:55,629 --> 01:14:55,639
area so going to one of those would mean
 

3713
01:14:55,639 --> 01:14:57,750
area so going to one of those would mean
you face to face met with some actual

3714
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:57,760
you face to face met with some actual
 

3715
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,990
you face to face met with some actual
live teachers who are grappling with

3716
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,000
live teachers who are grappling with
 

3717
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,110
live teachers who are grappling with
this stuff because for me it's it's not

3718
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:02,120
this stuff because for me it's it's not
 

3719
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,350
this stuff because for me it's it's not
so much about um doing some grand

3720
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
so much about um doing some grand
 

3721
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,830
so much about um doing some grand
national scale thing I think what we as

3722
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:06,840
national scale thing I think what we as
 

3723
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,669
national scale thing I think what we as
individuals and even companies did to do

3724
01:15:08,669 --> 01:15:08,679
individuals and even companies did to do
 

3725
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:10,910
individuals and even companies did to do
is just get stuck in locally that means

3726
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:10,920
is just get stuck in locally that means
 

3727
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,189
is just get stuck in locally that means
that means meeting teachers and not

3728
01:15:12,189 --> 01:15:12,199
that means meeting teachers and not
 

3729
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:13,590
that means meeting teachers and not
saying no I'm going to tell you what to

various times but in the America there's
 

3967
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,750
various times but in the America there's
something called the computer science

3968
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
something called the computer science
 

3969

Teachers Association um csta which is a

3970
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:53,560
Teachers Association um csta which is a
 

3971
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,629
Teachers Association um csta which is a
sort of equivalent of Cass a little bit

3972
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:55,639
sort of equivalent of Cass a little bit
 

3973
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:57,790
sort of equivalent of Cass a little bit
more teacher Centric than than casses

3974
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:57,800
more teacher Centric than than casses
 

3975
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,590
more teacher Centric than than casses
but um sort of equivalent of Cass in the

3976
01:19:59,590 --> 01:19:59,600
but um sort of equivalent of Cass in the
 

3977
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,310
but um sort of equivalent of Cass in the
USA uh and I think in every country

3978
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:02,320
USA uh and I think in every country
 

3979
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,910
USA uh and I think in every country
there would be this activists who are

3980
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:04,920
there would be this activists who are
 

3981
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,629
there would be this activists who are
busy trying to do exactly what C is

3982
01:20:06,629 --> 01:20:06,639
busy trying to do exactly what C is
 

3983
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,110
busy trying to do exactly what C is
trying to do here cool okay I'll put
