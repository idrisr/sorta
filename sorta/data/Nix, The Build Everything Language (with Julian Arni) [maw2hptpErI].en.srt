00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,710
that's a different
podcast so you're here to talk about

162
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
podcast so you're here to talk about
 

163
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,589
podcast so you're here to talk about
building things

164
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:36,599
building things
 

165
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,830
building things
DevOps a topic sometimes I shy away from

166
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
DevOps a topic sometimes I shy away from
 

167
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,630
DevOps a topic sometimes I shy away from
cuz I found it so painful in the past

168
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
cuz I found it so painful in the past
 

169
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,309
cuz I found it so painful in the past
understandably yeah but but there's So

170
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
understandably yeah but but there's So
 

171
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,830
understandably yeah but but there's So
maybe I should tell you my background

172
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
maybe I should tell you my background
 

173
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,789
maybe I should tell you my background
just for a change

174
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:49,799
just for a change
 

175
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,070
just for a change
i worked at a company that used Nyx many

176
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
i worked at a company that used Nyx many
 

177
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,470
i worked at a company that used Nyx many
years ago as a contractor and they

178
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
years ago as a contractor and they
 

179
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,470
years ago as a contractor and they
basically paid me to learn Nyx because

180
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
basically paid me to learn Nyx because
 

181
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,550
basically paid me to learn Nyx because
they because I had to right so I've

182
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
they because I had to right so I've
 

183
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,390
they because I had to right so I've
always felt that I've come at Nyx from a

184
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
always felt that I've come at Nyx from a
 

185
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,670
always felt that I've come at Nyx from a
strange angle the the initial hump being

186
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
strange angle the the initial hump being
 

187
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,550
strange angle the the initial hump being
paid rather than voluntary yeah yeah so

188
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
paid rather than voluntary yeah yeah so
 

189
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,390
paid rather than voluntary yeah yeah so
and mandatory that was the other thing i

190
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
and mandatory that was the other thing i
 

191
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,390
and mandatory that was the other thing i
never had the here's why it's good i

192
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
never had the here's why it's good i
 

193
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,789
never had the here's why it's good i
just got told by dictat I should use it

194
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
just got told by dictat I should use it
 

195
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,870
just got told by dictat I should use it
so I'm hoping you can start by filling

196
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
so I'm hoping you can start by filling
 

197
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,150
so I'm hoping you can start by filling
in the why is Nick's good question

198
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
in the why is Nick's good question
 

199
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,670
in the why is Nick's good question
exactly so that I can convince all the

200
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
exactly so that I can convince all the
 

201
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,030
exactly so that I can convince all the
other people who are not being forced

202
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
other people who are not being forced
 

203
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,070
other people who are not being forced
and paid to do it to take a look at it

204
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
and paid to do it to take a look at it
 

205
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,629
and paid to do it to take a look at it
yeah um I think uh you know the sort of

206
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
yeah um I think uh you know the sort of
 

207
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,629
yeah um I think uh you know the sort of
space that it's operating in is the the

208
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
space that it's operating in is the the
 

209
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,189
space that it's operating in is the the
space of sort of reproducibility right

210
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
space of sort of reproducibility right
 

211
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,350
space of sort of reproducibility right
making sure that works on my computer

212
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
making sure that works on my computer
 

213
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,390
making sure that works on my computer
works on yours as well

214
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:41,400
works on yours as well
 

215
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,830
works on yours as well
um and that's a space that we as

216
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
um and that's a space that we as
 

217
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,670
um and that's a space that we as
developers are very familiar with and we

218
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
developers are very familiar with and we
 

219
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,670
developers are very familiar with and we
have our techniques to solve it right i

220
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
have our techniques to solve it right i
 

221
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,189
have our techniques to solve it right i
think uh Docker is is is maybe is by far

222
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
think uh Docker is is is maybe is by far
 

223
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,710
think uh Docker is is is maybe is by far
the most popular one u but

224
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:55,720
the most popular one u but
 

225
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,110
the most popular one u but
u Nyx is coming at the same problem um

226
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
u Nyx is coming at the same problem um
 

227
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,070
u Nyx is coming at the same problem um
from a very different angle

228
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,080
from a very different angle
 

229
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,670
from a very different angle
um

230
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:02,680
um
 

231
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,430
um
and and as a consequence it doesn't have

232
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
and and as a consequence it doesn't have
 

233
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,189
and and as a consequence it doesn't have
a lot of the problems that Docker has

234
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
a lot of the problems that Docker has
 

235
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,110
a lot of the problems that Docker has
which is actually you know to some

236
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
which is actually you know to some
 

237
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,029
which is actually you know to some
extent most obviously that it's not that

238
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
extent most obviously that it's not that
 

239
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,590
extent most obviously that it's not that
reproducible um if you want to you know

240
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
reproducible um if you want to you know
 

241
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,670
reproducible um if you want to you know
run the same Docker file twice and it's

242
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
run the same Docker file twice and it's
 

243
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,110
run the same Docker file twice and it's
not cached you could get very different

244
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
not cached you could get very different
 

245
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,029
not cached you could get very different
results but then additionally number of

246
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
results but then additionally number of
 

247
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,150
results but then additionally number of
other things it's hard to sort of

248
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
other things it's hard to sort of
 

249
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,310
other things it's hard to sort of
abstract over them it's hard to connect

250
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
abstract over them it's hard to connect
 

251
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,870
abstract over them it's hard to connect
multiple uh docker files together

252
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
multiple uh docker files together
 

253
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,749
multiple uh docker files together
combine them you end up spending so much

254
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
combine them you end up spending so much
 

255
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,590
combine them you end up spending so much
time um when you have docker images sort

256
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
time um when you have docker images sort
 

257
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,430
time um when you have docker images sort
of poking holes at their isol at the

258
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
of poking holes at their isol at the
 

259
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,110
of poking holes at their isol at the
isolation so that they can talk to one

260
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
isolation so that they can talk to one
 

261
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,270
isolation so that they can talk to one
another it's very different than the way

262
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
another it's very different than the way
 

263
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,790
another it's very different than the way
in which you program locally right like

264
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:39,800
in which you program locally right like
 

265
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,550
in which you program locally right like
usually you know if you think about the

266
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
usually you know if you think about the
 

267
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,469
usually you know if you think about the
Unix philosophy you have a pipe operator

268
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
Unix philosophy you have a pipe operator
 

269
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,670
Unix philosophy you have a pipe operator
between two different programs and

270
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
between two different programs and
 

271
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,189
between two different programs and
that's how you compose them whereas if

272
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
that's how you compose them whereas if
 

273
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,629
that's how you compose them whereas if
you have Docker images you suddenly have

274
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
you have Docker images you suddenly have
 

275
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,950
you have Docker images you suddenly have
to have HTTP ports and make them into

276
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
to have HTTP ports and make them into
 

277
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,710
to have HTTP ports and make them into
web applications or whatever whatever

278
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
web applications or whatever whatever
 

279
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,550
web applications or whatever whatever
mechanism it is it's very different than

280
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
mechanism it is it's very different than
 

281
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,830
mechanism it is it's very different than
than how you traditionally locally think

282
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
than how you traditionally locally think
 

283
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,909
than how you traditionally locally think
of programs and so there are all these

284
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
of programs and so there are all these
 

285
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,990
of programs and so there are all these
costs that are associated with with the

286
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
costs that are associated with with the
 

287
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,870
costs that are associated with with the
Docker model that aren't there in Nyx um

288
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
Docker model that aren't there in Nyx um
 

289
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,150
Docker model that aren't there in Nyx um
and additionally there are lots of

290
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
and additionally there are lots of
 

291
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,430
and additionally there are lots of
things that it enables that you wouldn't

292
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
things that it enables that you wouldn't
 

293
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,070
things that it enables that you wouldn't
even think are possible right so I think

294
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
even think are possible right so I think
 

295
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,710
even think are possible right so I think
um some of the things that are are quite

296
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
um some of the things that are are quite
 

297
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,230
um some of the things that are are quite
phenomenal is just the sort of uh the

298
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
phenomenal is just the sort of uh the
 

299
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,309
phenomenal is just the sort of uh the
sort of incredibly sophisticated build

300
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
sort of incredibly sophisticated build
 

301
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,230
sort of incredibly sophisticated build
caching that it has um and

302
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
caching that it has um and
 

303
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,790
caching that it has um and
um and you know with with once you sort

304
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
um and you know with with once you sort
 

305
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,790
um and you know with with once you sort
of start using Nexos the sort of which

306
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
of start using Nexos the sort of which
 

307
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,950
of start using Nexos the sort of which
hopefully we'll have time to get into

308
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
hopefully we'll have time to get into
 

309
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,790
hopefully we'll have time to get into
definitely

310
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
definitely
 

311
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,110
definitely
the it gets even even more exciting I

312
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
the it gets even even more exciting I
 

313
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,110
the it gets even even more exciting I
think right like you can sort of see uh

314
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
think right like you can sort of see uh
 

315
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,670
think right like you can sort of see uh
roll back sort

316
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:40,680
roll back sort

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,270
of get your machine to any any any state
very precisely um and know exactly what

320
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
very precisely um and know exactly what
 

321
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,350
very precisely um and know exactly what
state that is be able to diff machines

322
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
state that is be able to diff machines
 

323
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,070
state that is be able to diff machines
in in incredible detail

324
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
in in incredible detail
 

325
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,590
in in incredible detail
um with your usual sort of version

326
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:53,600
um with your usual sort of version
 

327
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,150
um with your usual sort of version
control tools um

328
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
control tools um
 

329
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,909
control tools um
cuz definitely Docker files sometimes

330
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
cuz definitely Docker files sometimes
 

331
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,629
cuz definitely Docker files sometimes
feel like a bit of a black hole

332
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
feel like a bit of a black hole
 

333
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,629
feel like a bit of a black hole
yeah the you know it in some sense it's

334
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
yeah the you know it in some sense it's
 

335
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,469
yeah the you know it in some sense it's
a it's a very nice interface the Docker

336
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
a it's a very nice interface the Docker
 

337
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,189
a it's a very nice interface the Docker
file that it's a very familiar interface

338
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
file that it's a very familiar interface
 

339
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,589
file that it's a very familiar interface
on the one hand right like you write a

340
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
on the one hand right like you write a
 

341
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,110
on the one hand right like you write a
essentially a bash script it's a little

342
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
essentially a bash script it's a little
 

343
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,790
essentially a bash script it's a little
bit different than a bash script but you

344
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
bit different than a bash script but you
 

345
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,670
bit different than a bash script but you
write a bash script and and then you

346
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
write a bash script and and then you
 

347
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,150
write a bash script and and then you
know it's like it's cached and you know

348
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
know it's like it's cached and you know
 

349
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,909
know it's like it's cached and you know
kind of isolated um and it's that that

350
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
kind of isolated um and it's that that
 

351
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,430
kind of isolated um and it's that that
sort of initial experience is very very

352
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
sort of initial experience is very very
 

353
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,350
sort of initial experience is very very
nice but then uh but then as you start

354
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
nice but then uh but then as you start
 

355
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,589
nice but then uh but then as you start
progressing beyond that first you know

356
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
progressing beyond that first you know
 

357
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,070
progressing beyond that first you know
those first five minutes it it becomes

358
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
those first five minutes it it becomes
 

359
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,430
those first five minutes it it becomes
cumbersome in a variety of different

360
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
cumbersome in a variety of different
 

361
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,670
cumbersome in a variety of different
ways yeah i think one of my least

362
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
ways yeah i think one of my least
 

363
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,309
ways yeah i think one of my least
favorite is that if you add a command to

364
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
favorite is that if you add a command to
 

365
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,469
favorite is that if you add a command to
a Docker file everything's groovy if you

366
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
a Docker file everything's groovy if you
 

367
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,150
a Docker file everything's groovy if you
want to go back and change an earlier

368
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
want to go back and change an earlier
 

369
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,110
want to go back and change an earlier
one suddenly you're in a real buildtime

370
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
one suddenly you're in a real buildtime
 

371
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,589
one suddenly you're in a real buildtime
problem right yeah that linearity is

372
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
problem right yeah that linearity is
 

373
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,510
problem right yeah that linearity is
very strange right like in some sense

374
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
very strange right like in some sense
 

375
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,390
very strange right like in some sense
the the caching is is linear right and

376
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
the the caching is is linear right and
 

377
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,350
the the caching is is linear right and
so uh uh you have to think very

378
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
so uh uh you have to think very
 

379
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,710
so uh uh you have to think very
carefully about the order in which you

380
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
carefully about the order in which you
 

381
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,710
carefully about the order in which you
do things and as you said if you change

382
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
do things and as you said if you change
 

383
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,070
do things and as you said if you change
something early on it might have

384
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
something early on it might have
 

385
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,950
something early on it might have
downstream consequences because you know

386
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
downstream consequences because you know
 

387
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,070
downstream consequences because you know
maybe you're downloading something

388
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
maybe you're downloading something
 

389
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,350
maybe you're downloading something
something from the internet and the

390
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
something from the internet and the
 

391
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,189
something from the internet and the
cache version that you had so far

392
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
cache version that you had so far
 

393
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,510
cache version that you had so far
changed and now um and now everything

394
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
changed and now um and now everything
 

395
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,869
changed and now um and now everything
else is going to be different as well

396
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
else is going to be different as well
 

397
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,070
else is going to be different as well
right so you're kind of in this Yeah

398
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
right so you're kind of in this Yeah
 

399
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,230
right so you're kind of in this Yeah
yeah yeah

400
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
yeah yeah
 

401
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,309
yeah yeah
so I think we should build up the

402
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
so I think we should build up the
 

403
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,869
so I think we should build up the
picture of how this all works and then

404
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
picture of how this all works and then
 

405
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,830
picture of how this all works and then
we can really talk about it so what's it

406
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
we can really talk about it so what's it
 

407
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,830
we can really talk about it so what's it
doing that Docker isn't what's the

408
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
doing that Docker isn't what's the
 

409
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,070
doing that Docker isn't what's the
what's the mental model for next yeah uh

410
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
what's the mental model for next yeah uh
 

411
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,430
what's the mental model for next yeah uh
Docker uh in some sense is you know

412
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
Docker uh in some sense is you know
 

413
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,829
Docker uh in some sense is you know
taking a snapshot of the file system at

414
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
taking a snapshot of the file system at
 

415
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,269
taking a snapshot of the file system at
a moment in time right you just take a

416
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
a moment in time right you just take a
 

417
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,029
a moment in time right you just take a
picture of whatever it is whatever state

418
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
picture of whatever it is whatever state
 

419
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,350
picture of whatever it is whatever state
it is that you got got into after

420
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
it is that you got got into after
 

421
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,670
it is that you got got into after
running a few commands and you save that

422
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:44,680
running a few commands and you save that
 

423
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,590
running a few commands and you save that
um and there's a story about layered

424
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
um and there's a story about layered
 

425
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,110
um and there's a story about layered
file system and whatnot but that's but

426
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
file system and whatnot but that's but
 

427
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,870
file system and whatnot but that's but
that's essentially the the approach

428
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
that's essentially the the approach
 

429
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,430
that's essentially the the approach
right yeah snapshot the whole OS call

430
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
right yeah snapshot the whole OS call
 

431
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,269
right yeah snapshot the whole OS call
that a base and then keep adding

432
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
that a base and then keep adding
 

433
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,070
that a base and then keep adding
snapshot changes on top yes exactly yeah

434
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,080
snapshot changes on top yes exactly yeah
 

435
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,350
snapshot changes on top yes exactly yeah
um Nyx is is much closer to a different

436
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
um Nyx is is much closer to a different
 

437
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,150
um Nyx is is much closer to a different
technique that is also very familiar uh

438
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
technique that is also very familiar uh
 

439
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,790
technique that is also very familiar uh
which is the package lock files right so

440
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
which is the package lock files right so
 

441
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,350
which is the package lock files right so
we we uh what I mean this by this is you

442
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
we we uh what I mean this by this is you
 

443
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,430
we we uh what I mean this by this is you
know you have language specific uh

444
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
know you have language specific uh
 

445
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,910
know you have language specific uh
tooling such as cargo or npm um that

446
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
tooling such as cargo or npm um that
 

447
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,230
tooling such as cargo or npm um that
nowadays or you know python pip uh or

448
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
nowadays or you know python pip uh or
 

449
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,829
nowadays or you know python pip uh or
the various other python tools um that

450
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
the various other python tools um that
 

451
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,870
the various other python tools um that
take you know your project and uh maybe

452
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
take you know your project and uh maybe
 

453
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,350
take you know your project and uh maybe
some some version bounds of dependencies

454
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
some some version bounds of dependencies
 

455
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,389
some some version bounds of dependencies
that you specified and talk to the

456
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
that you specified and talk to the
 

457
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,630
that you specified and talk to the
internet find out uh what versions are

458
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
internet find out uh what versions are
 

459
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,710
internet find out uh what versions are
available that match match what you

460
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
available that match match what you
 

461
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,350
available that match match what you
requested uh pick those versions and

462
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
requested uh pick those versions and
 

463
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,630
requested uh pick those versions and
then output that into a lock file what

464
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
then output that into a lock file what
 

465
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,590
then output that into a lock file what
versions it's picked now yeah to pin the

466
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
versions it's picked now yeah to pin the
 

467
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,750
versions it's picked now yeah to pin the
specific binary or the specific source

468
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
specific binary or the specific source
 

469
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,949
specific binary or the specific source
code exactly exactly so you can think of

470
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
code exactly exactly so you can think of
 

471
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,310
code exactly exactly so you can think of
this as what's happening is you know

472
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
this as what's happening is you know
 

473
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,430
this as what's happening is you know
after you've pinned this um the process

474
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
after you've pinned this um the process
 

475
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,430
after you've pinned this um the process
of dependency resolution with that lock

476
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
of dependency resolution with that lock
 

477
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,590
of dependency resolution with that lock
file is deterministic meaning it will

478
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
file is deterministic meaning it will
 

479
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,750
file is deterministic meaning it will
always be the same because you pinned it

480
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
always be the same because you pinned it
 

481
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,470
always be the same because you pinned it
you know prec very precisely not just a

482
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
you know prec very precisely not just a
 

483
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,110
you know prec very precisely not just a
version number because sometimes

484
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
version number because sometimes
 

485
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,750
version number because sometimes
uh you can change the meaning of a

486
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
uh you can change the meaning of a
 

487
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,310
uh you can change the meaning of a
version number uh but also the hash very

488
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
version number uh but also the hash very
 

489
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,150
version number uh but also the hash very
often right like it's a specific source

490
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
often right like it's a specific source
 

491
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,030
often right like it's a specific source
hash of so then after that if anyone

492
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
hash of so then after that if anyone
 

493
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,630
hash of so then after that if anyone
else tries installing it they'll get

494
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
else tries installing it they'll get
 

495
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,350
else tries installing it they'll get
exactly the same version um yeah because

496
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
exactly the same version um yeah because
 

497
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,670
exactly the same version um yeah because
it's usually p it's often pinned off git

498
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
it's usually p it's often pinned off git
 

499
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,949
it's usually p it's often pinned off git
which means it's cryptographically

500
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
which means it's cryptographically
 

501
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,150
which means it's cryptographically
secure all the way back through the

502
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
secure all the way back through the
 

503
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,550
secure all the way back through the
source code so you get bite for bite

504
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
source code so you get bite for bite
 

505
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,910
source code so you get bite for bite
exactly the same exactly the same

506
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
exactly the same exactly the same
 

507
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,110
exactly the same exactly the same
and so this is kind of you know that

508
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
and so this is kind of you know that
 

509
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,870
and so this is kind of you know that
lock file um is if you take that lock

510
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
lock file um is if you take that lock
 

511
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,110
lock file um is if you take that lock
file and extend it in two different ways

512
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
file and extend it in two different ways
 

513
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,630
file and extend it in two different ways
you get something that's that's

514
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
you get something that's that's
 

515
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,790
you get something that's that's
essentially the next idea right

516
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:47,800
essentially the next idea right
 

517
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,990
essentially the next idea right
um the first one is that you extend it

518
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
um the first one is that you extend it
 

519
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,430
um the first one is that you extend it
to everything right like it's not just

520
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
to everything right like it's not just
 

521
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,509
to everything right like it's not just
for a specific uh language language

522
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
for a specific uh language language
 

523
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,190
for a specific uh language language
dependencies right like it's not just

00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200

maybe you use core utils or something

572
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
maybe you use core utils or something
 

573
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,350
maybe you use core utils or something
like that right

574
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:00,360

 

575
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,430

or Yeah and often with languages you

576
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
or Yeah and often with languages you
 

577
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,190
or Yeah and often with languages you
even sort of you know you pin all the

578
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
even sort of you know you pin all the
 

579
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,350
even sort of you know you pin all the
versions down but you don't pin exactly

580
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
versions down but you don't pin exactly
 

581
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,030
versions down but you don't pin exactly
the compiler version or something like

582
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
the compiler version or something like
 

583
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,710
the compiler version or something like
that right like somehow the the domain

584
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
that right like somehow the the domain
 

585
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,629
that right like somehow the the domain
in which these lock files operate is

586
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
in which these lock files operate is
 

587
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,750
in which these lock files operate is
just the library versions

588
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
just the library versions
 

589
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,030
just the library versions
someone says it doesn't build on my

590
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
someone says it doesn't build on my
 

591
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,949
someone says it doesn't build on my
machine and you say well which OS are

592
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
machine and you say well which OS are
 

593
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,110
machine and you say well which OS are
you on which version of rest have you

594
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
you on which version of rest have you
 

595
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,269
you on which version of rest have you
got yeah and then you start waiting

596
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
got yeah and then you start waiting
 

597
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,910
got yeah and then you start waiting
through those reads even and that what

598
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
through those reads even and that what
 

599
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,430
through those reads even and that what
you mentioned is is a really good

600
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
you mentioned is is a really good
 

601
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,030
you mentioned is is a really good
reminder right like even another thing

602
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
reminder right like even another thing
 

603
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,030
reminder right like even another thing
that's down um is the OS version or

604
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
that's down um is the OS version or
 

605
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,949
that's down um is the OS version or
whether your architecture is 64 bits or

606
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
whether your architecture is 64 bits or

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,069
whether your architecture is 64 bits or

uh mic or Linux right uh all of those

610
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,240
uh mic or Linux right uh all of those
 

611
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,269
uh mic or Linux right uh all of those
things are pinned down um so that you

612
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
things are pinned down um so that you
 

613
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,150
things are pinned down um so that you
know like really

614
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,160
know like really
 

615
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,150
know like really
conceptually if you build it twice even

616
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
conceptually if you build it twice even
 

617
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,629
conceptually if you build it twice even
without C even without caching you'll

618
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
without C even without caching you'll
 

619
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,310
without C even without caching you'll
get exactly the same thing now I say

620
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
get exactly the same thing now I say
 

621
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,389
get exactly the same thing now I say
conceptually because there are small

622
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
conceptually because there are small
 

623
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,310
conceptually because there are small
exceptions that maybe we can get into at

624
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
exceptions that maybe we can get into at
 

625
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,910
exceptions that maybe we can get into at
some point um but that's but that's

626
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
some point um but that's but that's
 

627
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,150
some point um but that's but that's
number one right you you start with lock

628
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
number one right you you start with lock
 

629
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,110
number one right you you start with lock
files but you're going to pin down

630
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
files but you're going to pin down
 

631
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,470
files but you're going to pin down
everything right um

632
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
everything right um
 

633
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,910
everything right um
and then the other thing that I think is

634
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
and then the other thing that I think is
 

635
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,069
and then the other thing that I think is
a is a very very big deal is once you've

636
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
a is a very very big deal is once you've
 

637
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,550
a is a very very big deal is once you've
done

638
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:15,560
done
 

639
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,990
done
this you can use

640
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,000
this you can use
 

641
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,990
this you can use
um you can use when you build your

642
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
um you can use when you build your
 

643
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,069
um you can use when you build your
project right so you have you pin down

644
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
project right so you have you pin down
 

645
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,829
project right so you have you pin down
not just the Rust dependencies not just

646
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
not just the Rust dependencies not just
 

647
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,269
not just the Rust dependencies not just
the Go dependencies maybe you have a

648
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
the Go dependencies maybe you have a
 

649
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,750
the Go dependencies maybe you have a
multi- language project in a mono repo

650
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
multi- language project in a mono repo
 

651
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,949
multi- language project in a mono repo
that involves various different uh

652
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:31,959
that involves various different uh
 

653
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,389
that involves various different uh
languages you pin all of this down and

654
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
languages you pin all of this down and
 

655
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,870
languages you pin all of this down and
you ended up with a binary

656
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
you ended up with a binary
 

657
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,269
you ended up with a binary
the cool thing here is that you can give

658
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
the cool thing here is that you can give
 

659
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,150
the cool thing here is that you can give
it usually you know you you you might

660
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
it usually you know you you you might
 

661
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,629
it usually you know you you you might
end up with out or some some binary

662
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
end up with out or some some binary
 

663
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,790
end up with out or some some binary
version like that or my project and

664
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
version like that or my project and
 

665
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,269
version like that or my project and
that's the name of the binary but what

666
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
that's the name of the binary but what
 

667
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,150
that's the name of the binary but what
you could also do is name that binary

668
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
you could also do is name that binary
 

669
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,949
you could also do is name that binary
the hash of all of those inputs your

670
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
the hash of all of those inputs your
 

671
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,269
the hash of all of those inputs your
lock file plus your source code right

672
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,279
lock file plus your source code right
 

673
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,710
lock file plus your source code right
the lock file that includes everything

674
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
the lock file that includes everything
 

675
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,150
the lock file that includes everything
else that's not your source code and

676
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
else that's not your source code and
 

677
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,790
else that's not your source code and
your source code right yeah so you get a

678
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
your source code right yeah so you get a
 

679
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,269
your source code right yeah so you get a
cryptographic signature of that specific

680
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
cryptographic signature of that specific
 

681
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,550
cryptographic signature of that specific
binary yes yes and so now you have a a

682
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560
binary yes yes and so now you have a a
 

683
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,269
binary yes yes and so now you have a a
very good name to refer to that binary

684
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
very good name to refer to that binary
 

685
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,269
very good name to refer to that binary
and you can have various different

686
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
and you can have various different
 

687
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,269
and you can have various different
versions of the binary coexist right so

688
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
versions of the binary coexist right so
 

689
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,750
versions of the binary coexist right so
you build that for instance and then you

690
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
you build that for instance and then you
 

691
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,030
you build that for instance and then you
check out a different branch and you

692
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
check out a different branch and you
 

693
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,150
check out a different branch and you
build it and now you'll have two

694
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
build it and now you'll have two
 

695
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,470
build it and now you'll have two
different binaries with two different

696
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:23,480
different binaries with two different
 

697
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,590
different binaries with two different
names and they won't overwrite one

698
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
names and they won't overwrite one
 

699
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,269
names and they won't overwrite one
another usually when you do a cargo

700
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
another usually when you do a cargo
 

701
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,310
another usually when you do a cargo
build or npm build or or whatever it is

702
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
build or npm build or or whatever it is
 

703
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,069
build or npm build or or whatever it is
you you you will overwrite whatever

704
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
you you you will overwrite whatever
 

705
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,790
you you you will overwrite whatever
binary you had previously built uh

706
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
binary you had previously built uh
 

707
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,030
binary you had previously built uh
because there's a a specific name there

708
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
because there's a a specific name there
 

709
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,509
because there's a a specific name there
that that keeps changing and that has

710
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
that that keeps changing and that has
 

711
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,590
that that keeps changing and that has
you know if anyone was using that binary

712
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
you know if anyone was using that binary
 

713
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,949
you know if anyone was using that binary
now they have they'll have a different

714
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
now they have they'll have a different
 

715
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,910
now they have they'll have a different
version right yeah whereas with mix you

716
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
version right yeah whereas with mix you
 

717
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,990
version right yeah whereas with mix you
you tend to use these names and there's

718
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
you tend to use these names and there's
 

719
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,990
you tend to use these names and there's
there's there's a lot of infrastructure

720
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
there's there's a lot of infrastructure
 

721
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,069
there's there's a lot of infrastructure
around making it easier to refer to

722
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
around making it easier to refer to
 

723
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,389
around making it easier to refer to
software without having to explicitly

724
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
software without having to explicitly
 

725
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,150
software without having to explicitly
mention these hashes uh but that's you

726
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
mention these hashes uh but that's you
 

727
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,670
mention these hashes uh but that's you
know you're going to name everything

728
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
know you're going to name everything
 

729
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,069
know you're going to name everything
this way um and so various different

730
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
this way um and so various different
 

731
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,870
this way um and so various different
versions of of

732
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:03,880
versions of of
 

733
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,870
versions of of
of binaries of artifacts can coexist

734
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
of binaries of artifacts can coexist
 

735
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,790
of binaries of artifacts can coexist
without a problem right you do this for

736
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
without a problem right you do this for
 

737
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,750
without a problem right you do this for
directories as well so when you do a

738
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
directories as well so when you do a
 

739
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,829
directories as well so when you do a
system upgrade in Debian or whatever

740
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
system upgrade in Debian or whatever
 

741
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,750
system upgrade in Debian or whatever
operating system it is that you have

742
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
operating system it is that you have
 

743
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,590
operating system it is that you have
usually you'll overwrite the version of

744
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
usually you'll overwrite the version of
 

745
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,750
usually you'll overwrite the version of
Python that's in user bin or wherever it

746
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
Python that's in user bin or wherever it
 

747
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,509
Python that's in user bin or wherever it
is

748
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
is
 

749
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,150
is
sometimes with immediate regret exactly

750
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
sometimes with immediate regret exactly
 

751
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,629
sometimes with immediate regret exactly
go back and use it yeah yeah whereas

752
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
go back and use it yeah yeah whereas
 

753
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,350
go back and use it yeah yeah whereas
here you know my project can say "Oh I

754
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
here you know my project can say "Oh I
 

755
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,870
here you know my project can say "Oh I
want exactly this version of Python

756
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
want exactly this version of Python
 

757
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,269
want exactly this version of Python
that's known by this hash." And then

758
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
that's known by this hash." And then
 

759
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,430
that's known by this hash." And then
it'll never never as long as someone's

760
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
it'll never never as long as someone's
 

761
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,550
it'll never never as long as someone's
using that version it'll never get

762
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
using that version it'll never get
 

763
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,389
using that version it'll never get
deleted but you can upgrade your OS and

764
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
deleted but you can upgrade your OS and
 

765
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,509
deleted but you can upgrade your OS and
it'll just install a different version

766
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
it'll just install a different version
 

767
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,509
it'll just install a different version
of Python alongside it with a different

768
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
of Python alongside it with a different
 

769
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,150
of Python alongside it with a different
hash name yeah you know I've used this

770
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
hash name yeah you know I've used this
 

771
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,389
hash name yeah you know I've used this
to great advantage specifically when

772
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
to great advantage specifically when
 

773
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,389
to great advantage specifically when
I've been uh contracting for different

774
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
I've been uh contracting for different
 

775
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,389
I've been uh contracting for different
clients and you've got like one client

776
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
clients and you've got like one client
 

777
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,230
clients and you've got like one client
that's on this version of the JVM and

778
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
that's on this version of the JVM and
 

779
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,829
that's on this version of the JVM and
another that's on that version and you

780
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
another that's on that version and you
 

781
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,829
another that's on that version and you
want like maybe they have different

782
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
want like maybe they have different
 

783
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,470
want like maybe they have different
underlying C libraries and you want both

784
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
underlying C libraries and you want both
 

785
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,310
underlying C libraries and you want both
versions to coexist on your laptop so

786
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
versions to coexist on your laptop so
 

787
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,389
versions to coexist on your laptop so
you can work for both clients without

788
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
you can work for both clients without
 

789
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,110
you can work for both clients without
going insane it becomes trivial right

790
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
going insane it becomes trivial right
 

791
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,749
going insane it becomes trivial right
yeah yeah and this is this is where one

792
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
yeah yeah and this is this is where one
 

793
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,910
yeah yeah and this is this is where one
of the superpowers of Nyx that it's

794
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
of the superpowers of Nyx that it's
 

795
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,910
of the superpowers of Nyx that it's
quite famous for and readly so comes

796
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
quite famous for and readly so comes
 

797
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,430
quite famous for and readly so comes
from right this this notion of dev

798
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
from right this this notion of dev
 

799
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,189
from right this this notion of dev
shells um we have we have a little bit

800
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
shells um we have we have a little bit
 

801
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,749
shells um we have we have a little bit
of this uh sorry we have a little bit of

802
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
of this uh sorry we have a little bit of
 

803
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,389
of this uh sorry we have a little bit of
this with

804
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399
this with
 

805
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,910
this with
um with virtual ends and things like

806
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
um with virtual ends and things like
 

807
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,150
um with virtual ends and things like
that that allow you to sort of enter in

808
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
that that allow you to sort of enter in
 

809
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,230
that that allow you to sort of enter in
again in very limited ways enter a

810
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
again in very limited ways enter a
 

811
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,990
again in very limited ways enter a
specific Python environment with a

812
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
specific Python environment with a
 

813
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,590
specific Python environment with a
particular version of Python installed

814
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
particular version of Python installed
 

815
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,030
particular version of Python installed
and whatnot but Nyx again does this for

816
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
and whatnot but Nyx again does this for
 

817
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,509
and whatnot but Nyx again does this for
everything right so you can now create

818
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
everything right so you can now create
 

819
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,710
everything right so you can now create
development shells that are um that have

820
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
development shells that are um that have
 

821
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,590
development shells that are um that have
all of your all all the versions that

822
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
all of your all all the versions that
 

823
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,350
all of your all all the versions that
you want installed and what that does is

824
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
you want installed and what that does is
 

825
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,030
you want installed and what that does is
it just sim links into your path the

826
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
it just sim links into your path the
 

827
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,550
it just sim links into your path the
specific Python version you know they

828
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
specific Python version you know they
 

829
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,269
specific Python version you know they
have a hash python/ash or whatever hash

830
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
have a hash python/ash or whatever hash
 

831
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,990
have a hash python/ash or whatever hash
um and you just sim link that as Python

832
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
um and you just sim link that as Python
 

833
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,550
um and you just sim link that as Python
into your dev environment um when you

834
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
into your dev environment um when you
 

835
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,509
into your dev environment um when you
enter it um and then nonsim link that or

836
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
enter it um and then nonsim link that or
 

837
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,549
enter it um and then nonsim link that or
remove it from your path um but you know

838
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
remove it from your path um but you know
 

839
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,189
remove it from your path um but you know
you're never deleting anything or

840
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
you're never deleting anything or
 

841
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,789
you're never deleting anything or
overwriting it you're just sort of

842
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
overwriting it you're just sort of
 

843
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,990
overwriting it you're just sort of
entering an environment that exposes a

844
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
entering an environment that exposes a
 

845
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,470
entering an environment that exposes a
specific version of each of those things

846
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
specific version of each of those things
 

847
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,309
specific version of each of those things
under the path so that then you can

848
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
under the path so that then you can
 

849
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,710
under the path so that then you can
develop with the version of Python that

850
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
develop with the version of Python that
 

851
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,309
develop with the version of Python that
you want with a version of cargo and

852
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
you want with a version of cargo and
 

853
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,949
you want with a version of cargo and
rust C or whatever it is that you want

854
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
rust C or whatever it is that you want
 

855
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,990
rust C or whatever it is that you want
um and and this you know this is one of

856
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
um and and this you know this is one of
 

857
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,590
um and and this you know this is one of
the great joys is you know you can

858
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
the great joys is you know you can
 

859
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,510
the great joys is you know you can
create a project um in at work or in

860
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
create a project um in at work or in
 

861
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,990
create a project um in at work or in
your open source project make a dev

862
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
your open source project make a dev

867
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,750

to emulate everything can just do a Nyx

872
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
to emulate everything can just do a Nyx
 

873
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,390
to emulate everything can just do a Nyx
develop and enter that devshell with all

874
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
develop and enter that devshell with all
 

875
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,909
develop and enter that devshell with all
the tools that they need to build and

876
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
the tools that they need to build and
 

877
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,110
the tools that they need to build and
test and yeah yeah I I have I thought in

878
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
test and yeah yeah I I have I thought in
 

879
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,549
test and yeah yeah I I have I thought in
the past when you've got like

880
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
the past when you've got like
 

881
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,549
the past when you've got like
installation instructions that are more

882
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
installation instructions that are more
 

883
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,470
installation instructions that are more
than just build the language project

884
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
than just build the language project
 

885
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,669
than just build the language project
you've also got to install these

886
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
you've also got to install these
 

887
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,070
you've also got to install these
dependencies first

888
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
dependencies first
 

889
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,830
dependencies first
that's where like that should have been

890
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
that's where like that should have been
 

891
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,789
that's where like that should have been
next or something very similar right

892
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
next or something very similar right
 

893
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,070
next or something very similar right
yeah yeah also because it's you know

894
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
yeah yeah also because it's you know
 

895
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,070
yeah yeah also because it's you know
it's not just hard to sometimes hard to

896
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
it's not just hard to sometimes hard to
 

897
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,430
it's not just hard to sometimes hard to
follow those instructions but it's also

898
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
follow those instructions but it's also
 

899
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,669
follow those instructions but it's also
sometimes I mean I think very often hard

900
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
sometimes I mean I think very often hard
 

901
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,990
sometimes I mean I think very often hard
to write them correctly right because

902
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
to write them correctly right because
 

903
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,470
to write them correctly right because
you don't

904
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:19,480
you don't
 

905
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,909
you don't
know the dependencies of your project

906
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
know the dependencies of your project
 

907
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,830
know the dependencies of your project
are very often implicit right like you

908
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
are very often implicit right like you
 

909
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,510
are very often implicit right like you
don't know whether your project is or

910
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
don't know whether your project is or
 

911
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,630
don't know whether your project is or
you've forgotten whether you're using

912
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
you've forgotten whether you're using
 

913
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,110
you've forgotten whether you're using
zlib or or whether a particular version

914
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
zlib or or whether a particular version
 

915
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,029
zlib or or whether a particular version
of bash has to be installed versus

916
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
of bash has to be installed versus
 

917
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,510
of bash has to be installed versus
another because you know you have uh you

918
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
another because you know you have uh you
 

919
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,510
another because you know you have uh you
know some particular syntax that's only

920
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
know some particular syntax that's only
 

921
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,510
know some particular syntax that's only
available in bash 4 or up or whatever it

922
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
available in bash 4 or up or whatever it
 

923
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,430
available in bash 4 or up or whatever it
is right yeah yeah this is another thing

924
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
is right yeah yeah this is another thing
 

925
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,270
is right yeah yeah this is another thing
you get with Nyx which is the isolation

926
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
you get with Nyx which is the isolation
 

927
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,669
you get with Nyx which is the isolation
which gives you an environment that

928
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
which gives you an environment that
 

929
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,510
which gives you an environment that
doesn't include the things you're used

930
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
doesn't include the things you're used
 

931
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,150
doesn't include the things you're used
to having on your laptop yeah yeah

932
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
to having on your laptop yeah yeah
 

933
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,590
to having on your laptop yeah yeah
exactly so that you know exactly what it

934
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
exactly so that you know exactly what it
 

935
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,830
exactly so that you know exactly what it
is that matters right like it's uh being

936
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
is that matters right like it's uh being
 

937
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,230
is that matters right like it's uh being
able to empty empty your environment is

938
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
able to empty empty your environment is
 

939
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,510
able to empty empty your environment is
really important to understanding what

940
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
really important to understanding what
 

941
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,070
really important to understanding what
it is that you actually need right yeah

942
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
it is that you actually need right yeah
 

943
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,669
it is that you actually need right yeah
yeah so I'm sure I've hit that with

944
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
yeah so I'm sure I've hit that with
 

945
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,909
yeah so I'm sure I've hit that with
something like image magic it's like oh

946
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
something like image magic it's like oh
 

947
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,350
something like image magic it's like oh
yeah you also need to install image

948
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
yeah you also need to install image
 

949
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,390
yeah you also need to install image
magic i hadn't put that in the

950
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
magic i hadn't put that in the
 

951
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,830
magic i hadn't put that in the
instructions cuz I've always got it

952
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
instructions cuz I've always got it
 

953
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,710
instructions cuz I've always got it
installed yeah yeah yeah exactly and I

954
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
installed yeah yeah yeah exactly and I
 

955
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,470
installed yeah yeah yeah exactly and I
hadn't thought about it yeah okay

956
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:11,480
hadn't thought about it yeah okay
 

957
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,870
hadn't thought about it yeah okay
so I think I think there's if you if

958
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
so I think I think there's if you if
 

959
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,470
so I think I think there's if you if
someone has bought into the argument

960
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
someone has bought into the argument
 

961
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,750
someone has bought into the argument
that like a cargo.lo file or a package

962
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
that like a cargo.lo file or a package
 

963
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,909
that like a cargo.lo file or a package
lock file or something like that is a

964
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
lock file or something like that is a
 

965
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,990
lock file or something like that is a
good idea we could go deeper and apply

966
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
good idea we could go deeper and apply
 

967
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,630
good idea we could go deeper and apply
that to all the surrounding stuff for

968
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
that to all the surrounding stuff for
 

969
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,150
that to all the surrounding stuff for
the language the question is how how

970
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
the language the question is how how
 

971
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,150
the language the question is how how
does Nyx do it and what will it cost me

972
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
does Nyx do it and what will it cost me
 

973
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,390
does Nyx do it and what will it cost me
to start using it yeah

974
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:37,400
to start using it yeah
 

975
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,190
to start using it yeah
uh you know fundamentally uh what what

976
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
uh you know fundamentally uh what what
 

977
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,070
uh you know fundamentally uh what what
what the experience of you know I think

978
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
what the experience of you know I think
 

979
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,029
what the experience of you know I think
the the fundamental sort of unit of uh

980
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
the the fundamental sort of unit of uh
 

981
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,549
the the fundamental sort of unit of uh
uh nyx is a build derivation you know I

982
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
uh nyx is a build derivation you know I
 

983
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,870
uh nyx is a build derivation you know I
won't go into details about that

984
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
won't go into details about that
 

985
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,990
won't go into details about that
terminology yet but um fundamentally you

986
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000
terminology yet but um fundamentally you
 

987
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,150
terminology yet but um fundamentally you
know a recipe for how to build a project

988
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
know a recipe for how to build a project
 

989
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,630
know a recipe for how to build a project
is is and then actually building it is

990
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
is is and then actually building it is
 

991
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,789
is is and then actually building it is
is what Nick cares about and the way

992
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
is what Nick cares about and the way
 

993
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,830
is what Nick cares about and the way
which does that is by isolating the

994
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:05,840
which does that is by isolating the
 

995
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,150
which does that is by isolating the
build environment in sandboxing it so

996
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,160
build environment in sandboxing it so
 

997
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,710
build environment in sandboxing it so
that you don't have

998
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:11,720
that you don't have
 

999
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,110
that you don't have
um don't have uh anything that you

1000
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
um don't have uh anything that you
 

1001
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,510
um don't have uh anything that you
didn't specify right so and then there

1002
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
didn't specify right so and then there
 

1003
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,110
didn't specify right so and then there
you specify usually something like a

1004
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
you specify usually something like a
 

1005
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,150
you specify usually something like a
bash uh and this way it's you know

1006
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,160
bash uh and this way it's you know
 

1007
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,430
bash uh and this way it's you know
somewhat similar to to docker you

1008
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
somewhat similar to to docker you
 

1009
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,870
somewhat similar to to docker you
specify a little script that says this

1010
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
specify a little script that says this
 

1011
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,430
specify a little script that says this
is how you will build my project um you

1012
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440
is how you will build my project um you
 

1013
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,990
is how you will build my project um you
know maybe it's cd into this directory

1014
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
know maybe it's cd into this directory
 

1015
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,870
know maybe it's cd into this directory
and and do a cargo build or a make or

1016
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
and and do a cargo build or a make or
 

1017
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,390
and and do a cargo build or a make or
whatever it is right

1018
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400
whatever it is right
 

1019
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,149
whatever it is right
and there's a little recipe there but

1020
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
and there's a little recipe there but
 

1021
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,909
and there's a little recipe there but
it's running in without network access

1022
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
it's running in without network access
 

1023
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,510
it's running in without network access
um without access to the rest of the

1024
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
um without access to the rest of the
 

1025
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,750
um without access to the rest of the
file system that's not your repository

1026
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
file system that's not your repository
 

1027
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,149
file system that's not your repository
or main directory so it's not

1028
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
or main directory so it's not
 

1029
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,630
or main directory so it's not
accidentally picking up hidden inputs

1030
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
accidentally picking up hidden inputs
 

1031
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,070
accidentally picking up hidden inputs
that you hadn't thought about exactly um

1032
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
that you hadn't thought about exactly um
 

1033
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,750
that you hadn't thought about exactly um
you won't have a version of Python at

1034
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
you won't have a version of Python at
 

1035
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,430
you won't have a version of Python at
all unless you say I want a version of

1036
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
all unless you say I want a version of
 

1037
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,950
all unless you say I want a version of
Python and then you have to say what

1038
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
Python and then you have to say what
 

1039
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,870
Python and then you have to say what
version this is right yeah yeah

1040
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:01,880
version this is right yeah yeah
 

1041
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,110
version this is right yeah yeah
um and and so then you have this recipe

1042
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
um and and so then you have this recipe
 

1043
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,110
um and and so then you have this recipe
that you know uh can be run by someone

1044
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
that you know uh can be run by someone
 

1045
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,630
that you know uh can be run by someone
else that will you know next will again

1046
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
else that will you know next will again
 

1047
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,029
else that will you know next will again
um do do exactly the same thing isolate

1048
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
um do do exactly the same thing isolate
 

1049
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,270
um do do exactly the same thing isolate
you know create an isolated sandbox um

1050
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
you know create an isolated sandbox um
 

1051
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,789
you know create an isolated sandbox um
and then run this recipe right um making

1052
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
and then run this recipe right um making
 

1053
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,230
and then run this recipe right um making
sure that any dependencies that you

1054
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
sure that any dependencies that you
 

1055
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,149
sure that any dependencies that you
specified are in fact available to it

1056
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
specified are in fact available to it
 

1057
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,510
specified are in fact available to it
right so if you said I want this version

1058
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
right so if you said I want this version
 

1059
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,510
right so if you said I want this version
of Python and this version of cargo then

1060
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
of Python and this version of cargo then
 

1061
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,950
of Python and this version of cargo then
those things will be available but

1062
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
those things will be available but
 

1063
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,270
those things will be available but
nothing else

1064
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,280
nothing else
 

1065
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,950
nothing else
will Yeah that's that's that's how it

1066
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
will Yeah that's that's that's how it
 

1067
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,789
will Yeah that's that's that's how it
kind of operates but uh you know there's

1068
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
kind of operates but uh you know there's
 

1069
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,470
kind of operates but uh you know there's
also this sort of surface level language

1070
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
also this sort of surface level language
 

1071
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,830
also this sort of surface level language
and the same way with with the docker

1072
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
and the same way with with the docker
 

1073
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,950
and the same way with with the docker
file there's there's this semi bash

1074
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
file there's there's this semi bash
 

1075
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,549
file there's there's this semi bash
syntax you know um in next there's also

1076
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
syntax you know um in next there's also
 

1077
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,630
syntax you know um in next there's also
next language that's the equivalent

1078
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
next language that's the equivalent
 

1079
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,630
next language that's the equivalent
right so it's you you write these little

1080
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
right so it's you you write these little
 

1081
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,870
right so it's you you write these little
data structures that explain your build

1082
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
data structures that explain your build
 

1083
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,669
data structures that explain your build
recipe right and most obviously what

1084
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
recipe right and most obviously what
 

1085
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,789
recipe right and most obviously what
that contains is the script that will do

1086
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
that contains is the script that will do
 

1087
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,029
that contains is the script that will do
the building and then also the

1088
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
the building and then also the
 

1089
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,029
the building and then also the
dependencies right so you you specify

1090
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
dependencies right so you you specify
 

1091
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,630
dependencies right so you you specify
packages just bash or whatever

1092
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:05,640
packages just bash or whatever
 

1093
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,390
packages just bash or whatever
um and that will add those things to uh

1094
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
um and that will add those things to uh
 

1095
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,549
um and that will add those things to uh
to your dependencies so one thing I've

1096
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:12,559
to your dependencies so one thing I've
 

1097
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,750
to your dependencies so one thing I've
always wondered and never actually

1098
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
always wondered and never actually
 

1099
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,110
always wondered and never actually
looked into maybe you know the answer to

1100
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
looked into maybe you know the answer to
 

1101
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,310
looked into maybe you know the answer to
this but if I want to build my Rust

1102
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,320
this but if I want to build my Rust
 

1103
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,789
this but if I want to build my Rust
project Mhm i will specify one of my

1104
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
project Mhm i will specify one of my
 

1105
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,870
project Mhm i will specify one of my
dependencies is Rust the language so Nyx

1106
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
dependencies is Rust the language so Nyx
 

1107
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,630
dependencies is Rust the language so Nyx
will go off to the recipe to build Rust

1108
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
will go off to the recipe to build Rust
 

1109
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,909
will go off to the recipe to build Rust
the language and it will find that one

1110
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
the language and it will find that one
 

1111
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,270
the language and it will find that one
of the dependencies is GCC let's say

1112
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
of the dependencies is GCC let's say
 

1113
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,190
of the dependencies is GCC let's say
yeah and goes off for the recipe for GCC

1114
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
yeah and goes off for the recipe for GCC
 

1115
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,029
yeah and goes off for the recipe for GCC
it finds one of the dependencies to that

1116
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
it finds one of the dependencies to that
 

1117
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,230
it finds one of the dependencies to that
is a specific kernel how far back does

1118
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
is a specific kernel how far back does
 

1119
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,870
is a specific kernel how far back does
it go what's the if it's turtles all the

1120
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
it go what's the if it's turtles all the
 

1121
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,190
it go what's the if it's turtles all the
way down what's the base turtle of this

1122
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
way down what's the base turtle of this
 

1123
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,390
way down what's the base turtle of this
build

1124
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
build
 

1125
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,390
build
uh there is you know there's work to

1126
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
uh there is you know there's work to
 

1127
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,950
uh there is you know there's work to
sort of have a minimal sort of

1128
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:49,960
sort of have a minimal sort of
 

1129
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,190
sort of have a minimal sort of
uh minimal base um so that you know

1130
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
uh minimal base um so that you know
 

1131
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,029
uh minimal base um so that you know
these usually with these things it's a

1132
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
these usually with these things it's a
 

1133
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,390
these usually with these things it's a
little bit like these compiler versions

1134
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
little bit like these compiler versions
 

1135
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,549
little bit like these compiler versions
right like with compilers very often

1136
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559
right like with compilers very often
 

1137
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,990
right like with compilers very often
compilers are written in the language

1138
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,000
compilers are written in the language
 

1139
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,630
compilers are written in the language
that they compile yeah I don't know an

1140
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
that they compile yeah I don't know an
 

1141
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,870
that they compile yeah I don't know an
example is I think rust but also hasll

1142
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:04,880
example is I think rust but also hasll
 

1143
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,470
example is I think rust but also hasll
right like um and so how do you get to

1144
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
right like um and so how do you get to
 

1145
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,710
right like um and so how do you get to
how do you get to produ produce the

1146
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
how do you get to produ produce the
 

1147
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,149
how do you get to produ produce the
current compiler version well you get an

1148
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
current compiler version well you get an
 

1149
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,990
current compiler version well you get an
earlier one and you use it compile the

1150
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,000
earlier one and you use it compile the
 

1151
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,950
earlier one and you use it compile the
source code right and you know this is a

1152
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
source code right and you know this is a
 

1153
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,630
source code right and you know this is a
little bit annoying for reproducibility

1154
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
little bit annoying for reproducibility
 

1155
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,230
little bit annoying for reproducibility
and for for making sure so so there's

1156
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
and for for making sure so so there's
 

1157
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,830
and for for making sure so so there's
work to to to make the space a little

1158
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
work to to to make the space a little
 

1159
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,510
work to to to make the space a little
bit simpler um but in practical terms it

1160
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,520
bit simpler um but in practical terms it
 

1161
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,909
bit simpler um but in practical terms it
won't go that far down right because

1162
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
won't go that far down right because
 

1163
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,149
won't go that far down right because
when you need a dependency such as u

1164
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:35,159
when you need a dependency such as u
 

1165
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,630
when you need a dependency such as u
rust it you know someone in the next

1166
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,640
rust it you know someone in the next
 

1167
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,950
rust it you know someone in the next
world had to uh build that Rust compiler

1168
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
world had to uh build that Rust compiler
 

1169
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,390
world had to uh build that Rust compiler
uh but there's an XOS organization that

1170
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
uh but there's an XOS organization that
 

1171
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,070
uh but there's an XOS organization that
um for 100 thou nearly 100,000 different

1172
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
um for 100 thou nearly 100,000 different
 

1173
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,390
um for 100 thou nearly 100,000 different
packages does the builds are already um

1174
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
packages does the builds are already um
 

1175
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,669
packages does the builds are already um
and this gets into a different thing

1176
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
and this gets into a different thing
 

1177
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,110
and this gets into a different thing
that um is very very nice about Rust

1178
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
that um is very very nice about Rust
 

1179
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,270
that um is very very nice about Rust
about Nyx um which is binary

1180
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,280
about Nyx um which is binary
 

1181
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,230
about Nyx um which is binary
substitution right so if you're asking

1182
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:02,240
substitution right so if you're asking
 

1183
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,630
substitution right so if you're asking
for a thing by this very specific name

1184
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
for a thing by this very specific name
 

1185
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,630
for a thing by this very specific name
right if you're asking for cargo with a

1186
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
right if you're asking for cargo with a
 

1187
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,470
right if you're asking for cargo with a
specific

1188
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:07,480
specific
 

1189
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,470
specific
hash because

1190
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:09,480
hash because
 

1191
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,669
hash because
everything is specified in that hash

1192
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
everything is specified in that hash
 

1193
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,269
everything is specified in that hash
already everything that possibly matter

1194
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
already everything that possibly matter
 

1195
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,149
already everything that possibly matter
is in that hash if anyone that you trust

1196
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:16,159
is in that hash if anyone that you trust
 

1197
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,990
is in that hash if anyone that you trust
has already built that you can sort of

1198
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
has already built that you can sort of
 

1199
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,990
has already built that you can sort of
just ask the internet you know you have

1200
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
just ask the internet you know you have
 

1201
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,190
just ask the internet you know you have
to be careful that you trust these

1202
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
to be careful that you trust these
 

1203
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,830
to be careful that you trust these
people but you can ask the internet has

1204
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
people but you can ask the internet has
 

1205
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,750
people but you can ask the internet has
anyone built this and and if they say

1206
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
anyone built this and and if they say
 

1207
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,870
anyone built this and and if they say
yes you can just use that instead right

1208
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:28,880
yes you can just use that instead right
 

1209
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,510
yes you can just use that instead right
so you won't be building when you build

1210
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
so you won't be building when you build
 

1211
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,950
so you won't be building when you build
a cargo project you won't be building

1212
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
a cargo project you won't be building
 

1213
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,390
a cargo project you won't be building
all these things you'll be downloading a

1214
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
all these things you'll be downloading a
 

1215
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,510
all these things you'll be downloading a
binary uh that is the already built uh

1216
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
binary uh that is the already built uh
 

1217
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,990
binary uh that is the already built uh
because next can calculate that it must

1218
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
because next can calculate that it must
 

1219
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,029
because next can calculate that it must
have come from the same tree of depend

1220
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,039
have come from the same tree of depend
 

1221
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,870
have come from the same tree of depend
the exact same tree of dependencies

1222
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
the exact same tree of dependencies
 

1223
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,549
the exact same tree of dependencies
exactly exactly in order to have the

1224
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
exactly exactly in order to have the
 

1225
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,870
exactly exactly in order to have the

1229
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,830

the git trick isn't it it's the same

1230
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,840
the git trick isn't it it's the same
 

1231
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,630
the git trick isn't it it's the same
trick that git uses yeah yeah hash it

1232
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
trick that git uses yeah yeah hash it
 

1233
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,510
trick that git uses yeah yeah hash it
build a tree of hashes yeah yeah yeah

1234
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
build a tree of hashes yeah yeah yeah
 

1235
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,750
build a tree of hashes yeah yeah yeah
that's right

1236
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:02,760
that's right
 

1237
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,909
that's right
um yeah hashes are you know in some

1238
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
um yeah hashes are you know in some
 

1239
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,549
um yeah hashes are you know in some
sense the the deeper lesson is just that

1240
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
sense the the deeper lesson is just that
 

1241
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,029
sense the the deeper lesson is just that
hashes are really good names for things

1242
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:12,039
hashes are really good names for things
 

1243
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,310
hashes are really good names for things
yeah content what's it content

1244
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,320
yeah content what's it content
 

1245
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,390
yeah content what's it content
addressable file systems we have to get

1246
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
addressable file systems we have to get
 

1247
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,070
addressable file systems we have to get
that terminology in yeah yeah yeah yeah

1248
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,080
that terminology in yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

1249
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,149
that terminology in yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah that perhaps that's the solution to

1250
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:22,159
yeah that perhaps that's the solution to
 

1251
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,590
yeah that perhaps that's the solution to
one of the two hard problems in

1252
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
one of the two hard problems in
 

1253
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,149
one of the two hard problems in
programming right naming things by the

1254
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
programming right naming things by the
 

1255
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,510
programming right naming things by the
hash yeah exactly which to be fair also

1256
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
hash yeah exactly which to be fair also
 

1257
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,029
hash yeah exactly which to be fair also
you know Docker to some extent does as

1258
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
you know Docker to some extent does as
 

1259
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,789
you know Docker to some extent does as
well right but it hashes the output to

1260
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
well right but it hashes the output to
 

1261
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,510
well right but it hashes the output to
the result of what it built rather than

1262
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
the result of what it built rather than
 

1263
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,310
the result of what it built rather than
the inputs that went into

1264
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,320
the inputs that went into
 

1265
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,590
the inputs that went into
it yes

1266
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:42,600
it yes
 

1267
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,830
it yes
yeah that makes me just want to say I

1268
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
yeah that makes me just want to say I
 

1269
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,430
yeah that makes me just want to say I
think this is true you can confirm for

1270
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
think this is true you can confirm for
 

1271
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,549
think this is true you can confirm for
me you can also use Nyx to build Docker

1272
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
me you can also use Nyx to build Docker
 

1273
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,909
me you can also use Nyx to build Docker
images but with better hashing right

1274
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
images but with better hashing right
 

1275
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,710
images but with better hashing right
with better hashing like you get a NYX

1276
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
with better hashing like you get a NYX
 

1277
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,789
with better hashing like you get a NYX
quality input hash for your Docker

1278
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
quality input hash for your Docker
 

1279
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,750
quality input hash for your Docker
output that's That's right there's a

1280
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
output that's That's right there's a
 

1281
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,750
output that's That's right there's a
project that's quite widely used and in

1282
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
project that's quite widely used and in
 

1283
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,310
project that's quite widely used and in
in X packages itself that's a way of

1284
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
in X packages itself that's a way of
 

1285
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,230
in X packages itself that's a way of
building a layer docker image that where

1286
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
building a layer docker image that where
 

1287
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,350
building a layer docker image that where
the layers are quite minimal

1288
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:10,360
the layers are quite minimal
 

1289
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,750
the layers are quite minimal
um so you know it's easy to

1290
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:14,760
um so you know it's easy to
 

1291
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,070
um so you know it's easy to
uh if you think if you think about the

1292
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
uh if you think if you think about the
 

1293
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,789
uh if you think if you think about the
way Nyx operates right with these hashes

1294
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:20,799
way Nyx operates right with these hashes
 

1295
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,110
way Nyx operates right with these hashes
in some sense

1296
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,120
in some sense
 

1297
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,710
in some sense
it's solving

1298
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
it's solving
 

1299
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,269
it's solving
um solving the the problem that Docker

1300
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:27,279
um solving the the problem that Docker
 

1301
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,390
um solving the the problem that Docker
has that we mentioned before with

1302
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
has that we mentioned before with
 

1303
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,549
has that we mentioned before with
linearity right like with Docker it's

1304
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
linearity right like with Docker it's
 

1305
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,070
linearity right like with Docker it's
like if you change something earlier on

1306
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
like if you change something earlier on
 

1307
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,269
like if you change something earlier on
you don't know what how that's going to

1308
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
you don't know what how that's going to
 

1309
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,950
you don't know what how that's going to
impact the rest of the thing so you have

1310
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:34,960
impact the rest of the thing so you have
 

1311
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,870
impact the rest of the thing so you have
to go back and start building from that

1312
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
to go back and start building from that
 

1313
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,710
to go back and start building from that
from that line that you changed

1314
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
from that line that you changed
 

1315
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,230
from that line that you changed
essentially

1316
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,240
essentially
 

1317
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,549
essentially
but with Nyx we know that uh when you

1318
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
but with Nyx we know that uh when you
 

1319
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,230
but with Nyx we know that uh when you
build a dependency when you add

1320
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
build a dependency when you add
 

1321
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,310
build a dependency when you add
something to the file system uh it'll

1322
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
something to the file system uh it'll
 

1323
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,149
something to the file system uh it'll
only uh influence u nothing else will

1324
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
only uh influence u nothing else will
 

1325
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,909
only uh influence u nothing else will
influence it right like the that when

1326
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
influence it right like the that when
 

1327
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,110
influence it right like the that when
you build a python with a particular

1328
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
you build a python with a particular
 

1329
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,750
you build a python with a particular
hash version it'll be exactly that um so

1330
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,760
hash version it'll be exactly that um so
 

1331
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,750
hash version it'll be exactly that um so
you can really sort of make very very

1332
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
you can really sort of make very very
 

1333
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,029
you can really sort of make very very
fine grain layers and you can also

1334
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:01,039
fine grain layers and you can also
 

1335
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,230
fine grain layers and you can also
rearrange them somewhat more safely um

1336
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240
rearrange them somewhat more safely um
 

1337
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,470
rearrange them somewhat more safely um
and

1338
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:05,480
and
 

1339
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,830
and
that's that that is something that you

1340
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
that's that that is something that you
 

1341
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,510
that's that that is something that you
people use a lot

1342
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,520
people use a lot
 

1343
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,149
people use a lot
Yeah yeah i've I've definitely found the

1344
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
Yeah yeah i've I've definitely found the
 

1345
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,230
Yeah yeah i've I've definitely found the
experience of refactoring and rebuilding

1346
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
experience of refactoring and rebuilding
 

1347
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,350
experience of refactoring and rebuilding
a Nyx file to be much faster

1348
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,360
a Nyx file to be much faster
 

1349
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,950
a Nyx file to be much faster
than that a Docker file yeah yeah and

1350
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
than that a Docker file yeah yeah and
 

1351
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,269
than that a Docker file yeah yeah and
these things start to matter once it

1352
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:23,279
these things start to matter once it
 

1353
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,789
these things start to matter once it
becomes large enough that it is

1354
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
becomes large enough that it is
 

1355
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,029
becomes large enough that it is
something you want to maintain right

1356
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
something you want to maintain right
 

1357
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,430
something you want to maintain right
yeah yeah i think that that that's true

1358
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
yeah yeah i think that that that's true
 

1359
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,350
yeah yeah i think that that that's true
the other thing that we're that's a bit

1360
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
the other thing that we're that's a bit
 

1361
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,590
the other thing that we're that's a bit
harder to sort of give a sense for and I

1362
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
harder to sort of give a sense for and I
 

1363
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,630
harder to sort of give a sense for and I
recommend people just try out is that

1364
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
recommend people just try out is that
 

1365
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,230
recommend people just try out is that
you know has these ability to create a

1366
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
you know has these ability to create a
 

1367
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,590
you know has these ability to create a
you know what I always say is you

1368
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:43,600
you know what I always say is you
 

1369
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,190
you know what I always say is you
mentioned at the beginning of this

1370
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
mentioned at the beginning of this
 

1371
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,110
mentioned at the beginning of this
podcast you know like oh like DevOps is

1372
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
podcast you know like oh like DevOps is
 

1373
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,070
podcast you know like oh like DevOps is
something that I often shy away from um

1374
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
something that I often shy away from um
 

1375
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,990
something that I often shy away from um
and I think that that's a totally

1376
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
and I think that that's a totally
 

1377
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,750
and I think that that's a totally
comprehensible perspective because you

1378
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,760
comprehensible perspective because you
 

1379
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,149
comprehensible perspective because you
know when

1380
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:55,159
know when
 

1381
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,789
know when
we live in within a programming language

1382
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
we live in within a programming language
 

1383
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,470
we live in within a programming language
there's very clear semantics and we kind

1384
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
there's very clear semantics and we kind
 

1385
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,070
there's very clear semantics and we kind
of know how everything works and we can

1386
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
of know how everything works and we can
 

1387
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,750
of know how everything works and we can
kind of abstract things in exactly the

1388
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
kind of abstract things in exactly the
 

1389
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,830
kind of abstract things in exactly the
right way and capture them in you know

1390
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
right way and capture them in you know
 

1391
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,549
right way and capture them in you know
really find nice ways of expressing

1392
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
really find nice ways of expressing
 

1393
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,310
really find nice ways of expressing
things and the language doesn't work

1394
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
things and the language doesn't work
 

1395
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,909
things and the language doesn't work
against us and there's so many different

1396
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:11,919
against us and there's so many different
 

1397
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,590
against us and there's so many different
languages to choose from that you know

1398
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
languages to choose from that you know
 

1399
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,710
languages to choose from that you know
really almost capture the language of

1400
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
really almost capture the language of
 

1401
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,430
really almost capture the language of
thought itself um and then you have

1402
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,440
thought itself um and then you have
 

1403
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,269
thought itself um and then you have
these libraries that abstract over bits

1404
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
these libraries that abstract over bits
 

1405
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,029
these libraries that abstract over bits
of functionality and you can combine the

1406
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,039
of functionality and you can combine the
 

1407
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,470
of functionality and you can combine the
libraries and whatnot but then when it

1408
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
libraries and whatnot but then when it
 

1409
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,389
libraries and whatnot but then when it
comes to to infrastructure to DevOps

1410
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:26,399
comes to to infrastructure to DevOps
 

1411
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,750
comes to to infrastructure to DevOps
right like it really is like gnarly and

1412
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
right like it really is like gnarly and
 

1413
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,830
right like it really is like gnarly and
feels like duct tape all all over again

1414
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840
feels like duct tape all all over again
 

1415
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,070
feels like duct tape all all over again
yeah

1416
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
yeah
 

1417
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,630
yeah
whereas Nyx goes much further in the

1418
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
whereas Nyx goes much further in the
 

1419
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,430
whereas Nyx goes much further in the
direction of of making

1420
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,440
direction of of making
 

1421
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,830
direction of of making
uh DevOps feel like programming again

1422
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:43,840
uh DevOps feel like programming again
 

1423
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,510
uh DevOps feel like programming again
right like you can abstract over these

1424
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
right like you can abstract over these
 

1425
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,430
right like you can abstract over these
if you have multiple different servers

1426
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
if you have multiple different servers
 

1427
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,990
if you have multiple different servers
talking to one another not only can you

1428
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
talking to one another not only can you
 

1429
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,269
talking to one another not only can you
describe bills but you can describe

1430
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
describe bills but you can describe
 

1431
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,310
describe bills but you can describe
entire servers and not only entire

1432
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
entire servers and not only entire
 

1433
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,310
entire servers and not only entire
servers but entire sets of servers right

1434
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
servers but entire sets of servers right
 

1435
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,389
servers but entire sets of servers right
and so you can sort of

1436
00:28:59,389 --> 00:28:59,399
and so you can sort of
 

1437
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,149
and so you can sort of
really abstract over the idea of for

1438
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:02,159
really abstract over the idea of for
 

1439
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,430
really abstract over the idea of for
instance having all of your

1440
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,440
instance having all of your
 

1441
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,070
instance having all of your
infrastructure servers talk to a

1442
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
infrastructure servers talk to a
 

1443
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,789
infrastructure servers talk to a
Graphana Prometheus export things to

1444
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
Graphana Prometheus export things to
 

1445
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,230
Graphana Prometheus export things to
Grafana and Prometheus and that's just

1446
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
Grafana and Prometheus and that's just
 

1447
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,750
Grafana and Prometheus and that's just
becomes a flag right like something that

1448
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
becomes a flag right like something that
 

1449
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,389
becomes a flag right like something that
you can just enable um uh in all of your

1450
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
you can just enable um uh in all of your
 

1451
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,510
you can just enable um uh in all of your
servers yeah yeah like you can start to

1452
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:20,520
servers yeah yeah like you can start to
 

1453
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,350
servers yeah yeah like you can start to
because the description language the

1454
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
because the description language the
 

1455
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,870
because the description language the
equivalent of the Docker file is a lot

1456
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:24,880
equivalent of the Docker file is a lot
 

1457
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,190
equivalent of the Docker file is a lot
more like a programming language yes you

1458
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,200
more like a programming language yes you
 

1459
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,029
more like a programming language yes you
can start supplylying arguments to your

1460
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:30,039
can start supplylying arguments to your
 

1461
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,950
can start supplylying arguments to your
Exactly yeah supplying arguments and

1462
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
Exactly yeah supplying arguments and
 

1463
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,630
Exactly yeah supplying arguments and
writing functions that you know abstract

1464
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:34,640
writing functions that you know abstract
 

1465
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,310
writing functions that you know abstract
over uh Yeah exactly yeah yeah i'm

1466
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
over uh Yeah exactly yeah yeah i'm
 

1467
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,070
over uh Yeah exactly yeah yeah i'm
defining a build that builds several

1468
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
defining a build that builds several
 

1469
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,430
defining a build that builds several
different versions because it's

1470
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
different versions because it's
 

1471
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,630
different versions because it's
effectively just a for loop or a map

1472
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
effectively just a for loop or a map
 

1473
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,269
effectively just a for loop or a map
over build files yeah yeah

1474
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
over build files yeah yeah
 

1475
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,630
over build files yeah yeah
this So this sort of gets us into the

1476
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
this So this sort of gets us into the
 

1477
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,870
this So this sort of gets us into the
space of because we've talked about Nyx

1478
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
space of because we've talked about Nyx
 

1479
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,110
space of because we've talked about Nyx
the there are three parts to Nyx

1480
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,120
the there are three parts to Nyx
 

1481
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,830
the there are three parts to Nyx
possibly more nyx the tool for building

1482
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
possibly more nyx the tool for building
 

1483
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,830
possibly more nyx the tool for building
stuff with this dependency tree we've

1484
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
stuff with this dependency tree we've
 

1485
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,830
stuff with this dependency tree we've
talked about Nyx the language for

1486
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,840
talked about Nyx the language for
 

1487
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,630
talked about Nyx the language for
specifying those recipes you've hinted

1488
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,640
specifying those recipes you've hinted
 

1489
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,269
specifying those recipes you've hinted
at Nick's OS do we have to buy into a

1490
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
at Nick's OS do we have to buy into a
 

1491
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,430
at Nick's OS do we have to buy into a
whole other OS

1492
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
whole other OS
 

1493
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,350
whole other OS
we do not have to buy into a whole other

1494
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
we do not have to buy into a whole other
 

1495
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,389
we do not have to buy into a whole other
OS this is entirely

1496
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:13,399
OS this is entirely
 

1497
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:16,230
OS this is entirely
optional entirely optional i you know

1498
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
optional entirely optional i you know
 

1499
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,470
optional entirely optional i you know
people I for instance run XOS and I

1500
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
people I for instance run XOS and I
 

1501
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,590
people I for instance run XOS and I
think a lot of people who uh are given

1502
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
think a lot of people who uh are given
 

1503
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,789
think a lot of people who uh are given
the chance and the opportunity to to

1504
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:24,799
the chance and the opportunity to to
 

1505
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,789
the chance and the opportunity to to
spend time learning Nex um often will uh

1506
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
spend time learning Nex um often will uh
 

1507
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,029
spend time learning Nex um often will uh
because there's a lot of joy to begin

1508
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
because there's a lot of joy to begin
 

1509
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,549
because there's a lot of joy to begin
from it but it's it's completely

1510
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:32,559
from it but it's it's completely
 

1511
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,190
from it but it's it's completely
optional

1512
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:34,200
optional
 

1513
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,549
optional
uh so what does it get you why would you

1514
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
uh so what does it get you why would you
 

1515
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,830
uh so what does it get you why would you
make that option

1516
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:38,840
make that option
 

1517
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,350
make that option
yeah I think you know when you think

1518
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
yeah I think you know when you think
 

1519
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,149
yeah I think you know when you think
about

1520
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:43,159
about
 

1521
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,430
about
um what

1522
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:46,440
um what
 

1523
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,750
um what
getting what getting a server to be to

1524
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
getting what getting a server to be to
 

1525
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,470
getting what getting a server to be to
be ready to do to to do the

1526
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
be ready to do to to do the
 

1527
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,909
be ready to do to to do the
functionality that you wanted to do

1528
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
functionality that you wanted to do
 

1529
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,470
functionality that you wanted to do
maybe run your your your web server or

1530
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
maybe run your your your web server or
 

1531
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,470
maybe run your your your web server or
whatever it is you know your website

1532
00:30:59,470 --> 00:30:59,480
whatever it is you know your website
 

1533
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,909
whatever it is you know your website
um there's usually like a lot of very

1534
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
um there's usually like a lot of very
 

1535
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,350
um there's usually like a lot of very
sort of imperative instructions such as

1536
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
sort of imperative instructions such as
 

1537
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,350
sort of imperative instructions such as
pseudo app get this and pseudo apps get

1538
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,360
pseudo app get this and pseudo apps get
 

1539
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,830
pseudo app get this and pseudo apps get
that and then you know move this file

1540
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
that and then you know move this file
 

1541
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,190
that and then you know move this file
here and whatnot right

1542
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,200
here and whatnot right
 

1543
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,190
here and whatnot right
um and

1544
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,200
um and
 

1545
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,070
um and
um and and as we generally know that

1546
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
um and and as we generally know that
 

1547
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,269
um and and as we generally know that
this this can be really really dangerous

1548
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
this this can be really really dangerous
 

1549
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,029
this this can be really really dangerous
as well because it's a very state

1550
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,039
as well because it's a very state
 

1551
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,870
as well because it's a very state
stateful system um if we if someone uh

1552
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,880
stateful system um if we if someone uh
 

1553
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,389
stateful system um if we if someone uh
logs in because they notice that there's

1554
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:28,399
logs in because they notice that there's
 

1555
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,070
logs in because they notice that there's
a problem maybe with a missing version

1556
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,080
a problem maybe with a missing version
 

1557
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,230
a problem maybe with a missing version
or whatever a missing binary maybe they

1558
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
or whatever a missing binary maybe they
 

1559
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,669
or whatever a missing binary maybe they
do a pseudo app get there um while sshed

1560
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
do a pseudo app get there um while sshed
 

1561
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,029
do a pseudo app get there um while sshed
in and that's you never know that that's

1562
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
in and that's you never know that that's
 

1563
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,230
in and that's you never know that that's
that was part of what makes this machine

1564
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
that was part of what makes this machine
 

1565
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,029
that was part of what makes this machine
tick what makes it go in the right way

1566
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:46,039
tick what makes it go in the right way
 

1567
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,470
tick what makes it go in the right way
um and that's a big problem because if

1568
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
um and that's a big problem because if
 

1569
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,830
um and that's a big problem because if
you need to migrate it somewhere else or

1570
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
you need to migrate it somewhere else or
 

1571
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,509
you need to migrate it somewhere else or
if you need to you know redundancy or

1572
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
if you need to you know redundancy or
 

1573
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,630
if you need to you know redundancy or
whatever you won't um uh you won't have

1574
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
whatever you won't um uh you won't have
 

1575
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,909
whatever you won't um uh you won't have
captured that and you'll forget about it

1576
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
captured that and you'll forget about it
 

1577
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,029
captured that and you'll forget about it
the next time around next if as we've

1578
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
the next time around next if as we've
 

1579
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,070
the next time around next if as we've
been talking about you know like it's

1580
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
been talking about you know like it's
 

1581
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,630
been talking about you know like it's
very much about sort of really isolating

1582
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:03,640
very much about sort of really isolating
 

1583
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,470
very much about sort of really isolating
uh uh isolating your system from all of

1584
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,480
uh uh isolating your system from all of
 

1585
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,750
uh uh isolating your system from all of
these uh stateful interactions right you

1586
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
these uh stateful interactions right you
 

1587
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,669
these uh stateful interactions right you
really have a build recipe that you

1588
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
really have a build recipe that you
 

1589
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,389
really have a build recipe that you
specify once declaratively and that's it

1590
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
specify once declaratively and that's it
 

1591
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,269
specify once declaratively and that's it
right like this the state that happens

1592
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:16,279
right like this the state that happens
 

1593
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,389
right like this the state that happens
afterwards that accumulates the croft

1594
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:18,399
afterwards that accumulates the croft
 

1595
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,630
afterwards that accumulates the croft
that accumulates in your in your uh your

1596
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
that accumulates in your in your uh your
 

1597
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,830
that accumulates in your in your uh your
own uh computer for instance is is

1598
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
own uh computer for instance is is
 

1599
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,669
own uh computer for instance is is
ignored during an X build for instance

1600
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:27,679
ignored during an X build for instance
 

1601
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,110
ignored during an X build for instance
right like it's all all about this

1602
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
right like it's all all about this
 

1603
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,669
right like it's all all about this
isolation that that captures that makes

1604
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:31,679
isolation that that captures that makes
 

1605
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,590
isolation that that captures that makes
it makes the recipe capture everything

1606
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
it makes the recipe capture everything
 

1607
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,950
it makes the recipe capture everything
there is about a build and it's the same

1608
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:36,960
there is about a build and it's the same
 

1609
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,350
there is about a build and it's the same
with OS right so you can specify an

1610
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
with OS right so you can specify an
 

1611
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,190
with OS right so you can specify an
entire OS that tells you exactly which

1612
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,200
entire OS that tells you exactly which
 

1613
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,389
entire OS that tells you exactly which
files you need uh to have installed um

1614
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:44,399
files you need uh to have installed um
 

1615
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,950
files you need uh to have installed um
which locations which systemd services

1616
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:46,960
which locations which systemd services
 

1617
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,710
which locations which systemd services
it's a Linux based distribution which

1618
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:48,720
it's a Linux based distribution which
 

1619
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,909
it's a Linux based distribution which
systemd services um are there and

1620
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:54,919
systemd services um are there and
 

1621
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:57,190
systemd services um are there and
um and then you have all this

1622
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
um and then you have all this
 

1623
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,710
um and then you have all this
information right so you can really if

1624
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
information right so you can really if
 

1625
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,310
information right so you can really if
you want to spin up a new server you can

1626
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
you want to spin up a new server you can
 

1627
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,909
you want to spin up a new server you can
very easily do that um uh by just

1628
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:03,919
very easily do that um uh by just
 

1629
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,470
very easily do that um uh by just
reusing this this this recipe

1630
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:07,480
reusing this this this recipe
 

1631
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,590
reusing this this this recipe
um yeah it's it's part of this I think

1632
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
um yeah it's it's part of this I think
 

1633
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,630
um yeah it's it's part of this I think
is again that that moving things from a

1634
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
is again that that moving things from a
 

1635
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,029
is again that that moving things from a
readme with a list of commands to type

1636
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
readme with a list of commands to type
 

1637
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,870
readme with a list of commands to type
at the command line into an actual

1638
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:20,880
at the command line into an actual
 

1639
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,149
at the command line into an actual
programming language where it's

1640
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:22,159
programming language where it's
 

1641
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,750
programming language where it's
repeatable right yeah yeah absolutely

1642
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
repeatable right yeah yeah absolutely
 

1643
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,669
repeatable right yeah yeah absolutely
yeah if we're describing it in pros

1644
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:27,679
yeah if we're describing it in pros
 

1645
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,990
yeah if we're describing it in pros
repeatedly across the whole industry we

1646
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
repeatedly across the whole industry we
 

1647
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,269
repeatedly across the whole industry we
ought to be describing it in a

1648
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:31,279
ought to be describing it in a
 

1649
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,509
ought to be describing it in a
programming language yeah yeah

1650
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:33,519
programming language yeah yeah
 

1651
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,430
programming language yeah yeah
absolutely yeah and and you know there

1652
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,440
absolutely yeah and and you know there
 

1653
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,350
absolutely yeah and and you know there
is

1654
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,360
is
 

1655
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,669
is
a people say you know like if if you're

1656
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
a people say you know like if if you're
 

1657
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,669
a people say you know like if if you're
doing the same action multiple times

1658
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
doing the same action multiple times
 

1659
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,269
doing the same action multiple times
often a technique that I heard that I

1660
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
often a technique that I heard that I
 

1661
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,990
often a technique that I heard that I
like a lot is write a little bash script

1662
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
like a lot is write a little bash script
 

1663
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,710
like a lot is write a little bash script
um that at first you know just prints

1664
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:48,720
um that at first you know just prints
 

1665
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,710
um that at first you know just prints
out uh the different section the steps

1666
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
out uh the different section the steps
 

1667
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,230
out uh the different section the steps
of the read me and you say like have you

1668
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
of the read me and you say like have you
 

1669
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,990
of the read me and you say like have you
done this yes or no but then you can

1670
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
done this yes or no but then you can
 

1671
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,909
done this yes or no but then you can
slowly start abstracting that right like

1672
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
slowly start abstracting that right like
 

1673
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,590
slowly start abstracting that right like
if there's a step that um is you can do

1674
00:33:59,590 --> 00:33:59,600
if there's a step that um is you can do
 

1675
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,110
if there's a step that um is you can do
automatically you can change that

1676
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,120
automatically you can change that
 

1677
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,110
automatically you can change that
instruction line for instead of just

1678
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
instruction line for instead of just
 

1679
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,669
instruction line for instead of just
echoing the instruction

1680
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:04,679
echoing the instruction
 

1681
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,669
echoing the instruction
you actually do it so this is you know

1682
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
you actually do it so this is you know
 

1683
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,069
you actually do it so this is you know
this is a

1684
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:10,079
this is a
 

1685
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,149
this is a
uh this doesn't solve the problem of rep

1686
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:12,159
uh this doesn't solve the problem of rep
 

1687
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,629
uh this doesn't solve the problem of rep
reproducibility but it does automate

1688
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
reproducibility but it does automate
 

1689
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,149
reproducibility but it does automate
something right this this shell

1690
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
something right this this shell
 

1691
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,069
something right this this shell
shellbased system whereas nyx really

1692
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:18,079
shellbased system whereas nyx really
 

1693
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,669
shellbased system whereas nyx really
solve the problem of reproducibility as

1694
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
solve the problem of reproducibility as
 

1695
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,950
solve the problem of reproducibility as
well right so that you don't need the

1696
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:20,960
well right so that you don't need the
 

1697
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,710
well right so that you don't need the
readme anymore right you just have one

1698
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
readme anymore right you just have one
 

1699
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,510
readme anymore right you just have one
command that does everything for you

1700
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520
command that does everything for you
 

1701
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,510
command that does everything for you
yeah yeah and it also takes care of some

1702
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
yeah yeah and it also takes care of some
 

1703
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,149
yeah yeah and it also takes care of some
of the sequencing right if it doesn't

1704
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,159
of the sequencing right if it doesn't
 

1705
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,669
of the sequencing right if it doesn't
matter which order you run the commands

1706
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
matter which order you run the commands
 

1707
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,109
matter which order you run the commands
in then you don't need to worry about

1708
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
in then you don't need to worry about
 

1709
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,510
in then you don't need to worry about
that and if it does you can specify it

1710
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
that and if it does you can specify it
 

1711
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,869
that and if it does you can specify it
as an actual sequence dependency right

1712
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:38,879
as an actual sequence dependency right
 

1713
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,829
as an actual sequence dependency right
right right right yeah and you can build

1714
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
right right right yeah and you can build
 

1715
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,270
right right right yeah and you can build
all you know all these dependencies that

1716
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:43,280
all you know all these dependencies that
 

1717
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,470
all you know all these dependencies that
we were talking about right like we can

1718
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
we were talking about right like we can
 

1719
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,829
we were talking about right like we can
build them in parallel right let's say

1720
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
build them in parallel right let's say
 

1721
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,069
build them in parallel right let's say
that you need both a Python version and

1722
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:48,079
that you need both a Python version and
 

1723
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,669
that you need both a Python version and
a Rust version usually you won't build

1724
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:49,679
a Rust version usually you won't build
 

1725
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,030
a Rust version usually you won't build
that locally yourself because as I

1726
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
that locally yourself because as I
 

1727
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,270
that locally yourself because as I
mentioned you'll be using a cache that's

1728
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,280
mentioned you'll be using a cache that's
 

1729
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,190
mentioned you'll be using a cache that's
already built it for you let's say that

1730
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,200
already built it for you let's say that
 

1731
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,550
already built it for you let's say that
for some reason you know you have a

1732
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
for some reason you know you have a
 

1733
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,230
for some reason you know you have a
patch to Python and you want to build it

1734
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:58,240
patch to Python and you want to build it
 

1735
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,710
patch to Python and you want to build it
yourself and the same for for uh the

1736
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:00,720
yourself and the same for for uh the
 

1737
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,190
yourself and the same for for uh the
Rust

1738
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:02,200
Rust
 

1739
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,630
Rust
compiler with Nyx you know like because

1740
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
compiler with Nyx you know like because
 

1741
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,310
compiler with Nyx you know like because
these these are very isolated you can

1742
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
these these are very isolated you can
 

1743
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,630
these these are very isolated you can
safely run these in parallel right um

1744
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:08,640
safely run these in parallel right um
 

1745
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,030
safely run these in parallel right um
and so this the sequentializing this

1746
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
and so this the sequentializing this
 

1747
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,030
and so this the sequentializing this
this annoying sequentializing of of

1748
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
this annoying sequentializing of of
 

1749
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,230
this annoying sequentializing of of
Docker um is something that happens a

1750
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,240
Docker um is something that happens a
 

1751
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,510
Docker um is something that happens a
lot less yeah and that specific example

1752
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
lot less yeah and that specific example
 

1753
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,230
lot less yeah and that specific example
I've seen play play out two ways the

1754
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
I've seen play play out two ways the
 

1755
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,990
I've seen play play out two ways the
first is that you can build each

1756
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,000
first is that you can build each
 

1757
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,030
first is that you can build each
language on different threads yeah and

1758
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,040
language on different threads yeah and
 

1759
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,670
language on different threads yeah and
and the second is like if you wanted to

1760
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
and the second is like if you wanted to
 

1761
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,349
and the second is like if you wanted to
do that with Docker would you get a

1762
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:31,359
do that with Docker would you get a
 

1763
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,910
do that with Docker would you get a
Python base image and add in Rust or

1764
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
Python base image and add in Rust or
 

1765
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,510
Python base image and add in Rust or
would you get a Rust base image and

1766
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
would you get a Rust base image and
 

1767
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,230
would you get a Rust base image and
install Python

1768
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,240
install Python
 

1769
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,670
install Python
it's probably just a question of which

1770
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:39,680
it's probably just a question of which
 

1771
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,150
it's probably just a question of which
one's harder to install first and that's

1772
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,160
one's harder to install first and that's
 

1773
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,430
one's harder to install first and that's
not the best answer I can imagine yeah

1774
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,440
not the best answer I can imagine yeah
 

1775
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,790
not the best answer I can imagine yeah
it's just the wrong structure in some

1776
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
it's just the wrong structure in some
 

1777
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,950
it's just the wrong structure in some
sense right

1778
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:47,960
sense right
 

1779
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,069
sense right
like a list yeah yeah append only is

1780
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
like a list yeah yeah append only is
 

1781
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,670
like a list yeah yeah append only is
probably not the right data structure

1782
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:53,680
probably not the right data structure
 

1783
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,310
probably not the right data structure
for uh build tools yeah

1784
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:57,320
for uh build tools yeah
 

1785
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,270
for uh build tools yeah
yeah okay so from there I

1786
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,280
yeah okay so from there I
 

1787
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,390
yeah okay so from there I
think one thing we haven't talked about

1788
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:05,400
think one thing we haven't talked about
 

1789
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,430
think one thing we haven't talked about
is time the effect of time on this

1790
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440
is time the effect of time on this
 

1791
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,270
is time the effect of time on this
because I have found Nick's very

1792
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
because I have found Nick's very
 

1793
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,190
because I have found Nick's very
interesting when I go back to old

1794
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
interesting when I go back to old
 

1795
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,069
interesting when I go back to old
projects mhm

1796
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079
projects mhm
 

1797
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,430
projects mhm
it's like

1798
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:18,440
it's like
 

1799
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,030
it's like
I especially when again I come back to

1800
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
I especially when again I come back to
 

1801
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,950
I especially when again I come back to
the time when I was doing a lot of

1802
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
the time when I was doing a lot of
 

1803
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,430
the time when I was doing a lot of
contracting for different companies

1804
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
contracting for different companies
 

1805
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,150
contracting for different companies
and I would like build a project and I

1806
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160
and I would like build a project and I
 

1807
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,230
and I would like build a project and I
accumulate this croft from old projects

1808
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
accumulate this croft from old projects
 

1809
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,710
accumulate this croft from old projects
and things I had to install for old

1810
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
and things I had to install for old
 

1811
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,950
and things I had to install for old
projects run out of disc space clear it

1812
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
projects run out of disc space clear it
 

1813
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,790
projects run out of disc space clear it
up go back to the other client and then

1814
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
up go back to the other client and then
 

1815
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,630
up go back to the other client and then
find I've got to reinstall all the old

1816
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:40,640
find I've got to reinstall all the old
 

1817
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,109
find I've got to reinstall all the old
dependencies for the previous project

1818
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119
dependencies for the previous project
 

1819
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,349
dependencies for the previous project
which might not even be possible or easy

1820
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:45,359
which might not even be possible or easy
 

1821
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,910
which might not even be possible or easy
right to find those dependencies anymore

1822
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
right to find those dependencies anymore
 

1823
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,550
right to find those dependencies anymore
yeah yeah and then you get into like oh

1824
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:50,560
yeah yeah and then you get into like oh
 

1825
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,829
yeah yeah and then you get into like oh
now I've got the latest version instead

1826
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
now I've got the latest version instead
 

1827
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,510
now I've got the latest version instead
of the version I installed when I was

1828
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
of the version I installed when I was
 

1829
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,150
of the version I installed when I was
working there 6 months ago yeah it's one

1830
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
working there 6 months ago yeah it's one
 

1831
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,910
working there 6 months ago yeah it's one
of those one of those nice advantages

1832
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920
of those one of those nice advantages
 

1833
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,390
of those one of those nice advantages
like once you've actually specified all

1834
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,400
like once you've actually specified all
 

1835
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,870
like once you've actually specified all
this in code either it's in the cache or

1836
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
this in code either it's in the cache or
 

1837
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,310
this in code either it's in the cache or
you can go and grab it from a remote

1838
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
you can go and grab it from a remote
 

1839
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,710
you can go and grab it from a remote
cache and rebuild it exactly as it was

1840
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
cache and rebuild it exactly as it was
 

1841
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,109
cache and rebuild it exactly as it was
right yeah yeah i Yeah it's it's it

1842
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
right yeah yeah i Yeah it's it's it
 

1843
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,950
right yeah yeah i Yeah it's it's it
feels like one thing people say a lot is

1844
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
feels like one thing people say a lot is
 

1845
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,109
feels like one thing people say a lot is
that it's a it's a little bit to a lot

1846
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,119
that it's a it's a little bit to a lot
 

1847
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,150
that it's a it's a little bit to a lot
more upfront cost um because you know

1848
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
more upfront cost um because you know
 

1849
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,790
more upfront cost um because you know
let's say that you're building a project

1850
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
let's say that you're building a project
 

1851
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,990
let's say that you're building a project
uh you already have a version of of of

1852
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,000
uh you already have a version of of of
 

1853
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,510
uh you already have a version of of of
uh Python that you already have

1854
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:25,520
uh Python that you already have
 

1855
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,510
uh Python that you already have
installed if you're a Python programmer

1856
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,520
installed if you're a Python programmer
 

1857
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,710
installed if you're a Python programmer
um and it's very easy to just be like oh

1858
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:29,720
um and it's very easy to just be like oh
 

1859
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,550
um and it's very easy to just be like oh
like Python so and so like put in a read

1860
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:32,560
like Python so and so like put in a read
 

1861
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,190
like Python so and so like put in a read
me Python Python this file is all you

1862
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,200
me Python Python this file is all you
 

1863
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,069
me Python Python this file is all you
need to do because for you it's no extra

1864
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:38,079
need to do because for you it's no extra
 

1865
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,109
need to do because for you it's no extra
work right like you already have the

1866
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
work right like you already have the
 

1867
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,190
work right like you already have the
Python version installed it seems like

1868
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,200
Python version installed it seems like
 

1869
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,190
Python version installed it seems like
it's no extra work you might maybe even

1870
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,200
it's no extra work you might maybe even
 

1871
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,190
it's no extra work you might maybe even
have the dependencies installed somehow

1872
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,200
have the dependencies installed somehow
 

1873
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,829
have the dependencies installed somehow
globally that he didn't

1874
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:46,839
globally that he didn't
 

1875
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,190
globally that he didn't
notice whereas Nyx forces you to be

1876
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
notice whereas Nyx forces you to be
 

1877
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,790
notice whereas Nyx forces you to be
upfront about that cost right like you

1878
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
upfront about that cost right like you
 

1879
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,109
upfront about that cost right like you
really have to uh you really have to uh

1880
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
really have to uh you really have to uh
 

1881
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,630
really have to uh you really have to uh
think about what Python version it is

1882
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
think about what Python version it is
 

1883
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,910
think about what Python version it is
that you're doing and you have to

1884
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:57,920
that you're doing and you have to
 

1885
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,589
that you're doing and you have to
specify those things but once you've

1886
00:37:59,589 --> 00:37:59,599
specify those things but once you've
 

1887
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,430
specify those things but once you've
paid that cost up front it continues

1888
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:01,440
paid that cost up front it continues
 

1889
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,030
paid that cost up front it continues
it's a gift that keeps on giving for

1890
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,040
it's a gift that keeps on giving for
 

1891
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,109
it's a gift that keeps on giving for
years in the future as you as you as you

1892
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:05,119
years in the future as you as you as you
 

1893
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,310
years in the future as you as you as you
mentioned right because if you come back

1894
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,320
mentioned right because if you come back
 

1895
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,550
mentioned right because if you come back
to a project from four years ago or five

1896
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:08,560
to a project from four years ago or five
 

1897
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,310
to a project from four years ago or five
years ago it still works yes yeah if you

1898
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,320
years ago it still works yes yeah if you
 

1899
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,310
years ago it still works yes yeah if you
you've got a good reason to believe that

1900
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,320
you've got a good reason to believe that
 

1901
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,550
you've got a good reason to believe that
it will still be able to build that

1902
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:16,560
it will still be able to build that
 

1903
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,430
it will still be able to build that
entire source tree again and build it

1904
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:19,440
entire source tree again and build it
 

1905
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,870
entire source tree again and build it
some of it may have aged out of the

1906
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
some of it may have aged out of the
 

1907
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,710
some of it may have aged out of the
remote cache but it's still possible

1908
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
remote cache but it's still possible
 

1909
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,589
remote cache but it's still possible
and and the cache has uh so far the

1910
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:27,599
and and the cache has uh so far the
 

1911
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,109
and and the cache has uh so far the
policy with the cache with the sort of

1912
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:30,119
policy with the cache with the sort of
 

1913
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,430
policy with the cache with the sort of
Nixos the Nyx or cache the sort of

1914
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:33,440
Nixos the Nyx or cache the sort of
 

1915
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,750
Nixos the Nyx or cache the sort of
official cache has been to keep things

1916
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
official cache has been to keep things
 

1917
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,069
official cache has been to keep things
indefinitely um that will probably

1918
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
indefinitely um that will probably
 

1919
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,069
indefinitely um that will probably
change but but it's still

1920
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:41,079
change but but it's still
 

1921
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,670
change but but it's still
uh it's still the case now even after a

1922
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
uh it's still the case now even after a
 

1923
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,470
uh it's still the case now even after a
number of years and um and that's really

1924
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:46,480
number of years and um and that's really
 

1925
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,990
number of years and um and that's really
exciting right like not only can you

1926
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,000
exciting right like not only can you
 

1927
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,630
exciting right like not only can you
build it again but you can build it

1928
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:50,640
build it again but you can build it
 

1929
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,950
build it again but you can build it
without doing a lot of rebuilds right

1930
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:52,960
without doing a lot of rebuilds right
 

1931
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,790
without doing a lot of rebuilds right
yeah without having I suppose that must

1932
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
yeah without having I suppose that must
 

1933
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,630
yeah without having I suppose that must
play into the amount of disk space it

1934
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
play into the amount of disk space it
 

1935
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,430
play into the amount of disk space it
uses because if you wanted to store the

1936
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
uses because if you wanted to store the
 

1937
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,750
uses because if you wanted to store the
binary for um every Docker image that

1938
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:03,760
binary for um every Docker image that
 

1939
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,790
binary for um every Docker image that
would be a different thing because

1940
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:04,800
would be a different thing because
 

1941
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,190
would be a different thing because
that's going to not just have Python

1942
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:08,200
that's going to not just have Python
 

1943
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,270
that's going to not just have Python
3.7.6 but it's going to have Python

1944
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:10,280
3.7.6 but it's going to have Python
 

1945
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,790
3.7.6 but it's going to have Python
3.7.6 for every different Docker file

1946
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:12,800
3.7.6 for every different Docker file
 

1947
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,310
3.7.6 for every different Docker file
that uses it right yeah yeah yeah that's

1948
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
that uses it right yeah yeah yeah that's
 

1949
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,030
that uses it right yeah yeah yeah that's
that's so the disk space issue is is is

1950
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040
that's so the disk space issue is is is
 

1951
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,870
that's so the disk space issue is is is
a serious one both with Nyx and with

1952
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:20,880
a serious one both with Nyx and with
 

1953
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,190
a serious one both with Nyx and with
Docker and it might be more serious with

1954
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,200
Docker and it might be more serious with
 

1955
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,430
Docker and it might be more serious with
Nyx than with Docker right like Oh okay

1956
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
Nyx than with Docker right like Oh okay
 

1957
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,950
Nyx than with Docker right like Oh okay
tell um

1958
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:27,960
tell um
 

1959
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,109
tell um
uh as you mentioned you know like um

1960
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
uh as you mentioned you know like um
 

1961
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,550
uh as you mentioned you know like um
with with Docker you have uh if you have

1962
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:34,560
with with Docker you have uh if you have
 

1963
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,790
with with Docker you have uh if you have
if you in in one Docker file you have a

1964
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:36,800
if you in in one Docker file you have a
 

1965
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,950
if you in in one Docker file you have a
Python version installed and another

1966
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:38,960
Python version installed and another
 

1967
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,390
Python version installed and another
Docker file you have a different Python

1968
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
Docker file you have a different Python
 

1969
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,790
Docker file you have a different Python
version installed and they don't share

1970
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:42,800
version installed and they don't share
 

1971
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,349
version installed and they don't share
uh layers um because they're different

1972
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
uh layers um because they're different
 

1973
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,069
uh layers um because they're different
images um or you did something earlier

1974
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:48,079
images um or you did something earlier
 

1975
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,069
images um or you did something earlier
on that's different then you'll have

1976
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:50,079
on that's different then you'll have
 

1977
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,150
on that's different then you'll have
that Python version that same exact

1978
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
that Python version that same exact
 

1979
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,589
that Python version that same exact
supposedly exactly the same Python

1980
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599
supposedly exactly the same Python
 

1981
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,430
supposedly exactly the same Python
version installed twice

1982
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
version installed twice
 

1983
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,349
version installed twice
That's the thing that Nyx solves if you

1984
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:57,359
That's the thing that Nyx solves if you
 

1985
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,589
That's the thing that Nyx solves if you
have the same Python version that you're

1986
00:39:59,589 --> 00:39:59,599
have the same Python version that you're
 

1987
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,390
have the same Python version that you're
using in two different projects it will

1988
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
using in two different projects it will
 

1989
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,390
using in two different projects it will
it will be stored in your Nix store only

1990
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,400
it will be stored in your Nix store only
 

1991
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,150
it will be stored in your Nix store only
once so on the one hand there's an

1992
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,160
once so on the one hand there's an
 

1993
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,150
once so on the one hand there's an
advantage here

1994
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
advantage here
 

1995
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,870
advantage here
but

1996
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:09,880
but
 

1997
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,950
but
um because every time you do a build

1998
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:12,960
um because every time you do a build
 

1999
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,349
um because every time you do a build
with with Nyx and you know if you're

2000
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:15,359
with with Nyx and you know if you're
 

2001
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,550
with with Nyx and you know if you're
working with Nyx this can happen a lot

2002
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
working with Nyx this can happen a lot
 

2003
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,069
working with Nyx this can happen a lot
whatever you change an environment

2004
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
whatever you change an environment
 

2005
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,390
whatever you change an environment
variable here or something else there or

2006
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
variable here or something else there or
 

2007
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,950
variable here or something else there or
a GCC version all of these things will

2008
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:24,960
a GCC version all of these things will
 

2009
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,550
a GCC version all of these things will
change the hash you know anything that

2010
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
change the hash you know anything that
 

2011
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,030
change the hash you know anything that
could possibly affect

2012
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
could possibly affect
 

2013
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,550
could possibly affect
um your project will change its name

2014
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,560
um your project will change its name
 

2015
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,230
um your project will change its name
which in turn means that it will be

2016
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,240
which in turn means that it will be
 

2017
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,349
which in turn means that it will be
stored twice um in so let's say you're

2018
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:37,359
stored twice um in so let's say you're
 

2019
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,069
stored twice um in so let's say you're
building a Rust project and you have a a

2020
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
building a Rust project and you have a a
 

2021
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,150
building a Rust project and you have a a
you want to add a comment in your source

2022
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,160
you want to add a comment in your source
 

2023
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,990
you want to add a comment in your source
code

2024
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,000
code
 

2025
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,829
code
and you built built it once with Nyx and

2026
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
and you built built it once with Nyx and
 

2027
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,150
and you built built it once with Nyx and
then again with Nyx

2028
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
then again with Nyx
 

2029
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,310
then again with Nyx
Because the source code is now different

2030
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:50,320
Because the source code is now different
 

2031
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,510
Because the source code is now different
the hash of the resulting artifact the

2032
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:53,520
the hash of the resulting artifact the
 

2033
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,069
the hash of the resulting artifact the
resulting binary will also be different

2034
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:56,079
resulting binary will also be different
 

2035
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,950
resulting binary will also be different
which means that they'll be stored in in

2036
00:40:59,950 --> 00:40:59,960
which means that they'll be stored in in
 

2037
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,309
which means that they'll be stored in in
twice with some exceptions and small

2038
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
twice with some exceptions and small
 

2039
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,069
twice with some exceptions and small
optimizations here and there but

2040
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
optimizations here and there but
 

2041
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,230
optimizations here and there but
essentially that's the idea right so you

2042
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,240
essentially that's the idea right so you
 

2043
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,630
essentially that's the idea right so you
end up using

2044
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:08,640
end up using
 

2045
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,870
end up using
accept that yeah I I think I can accept

2046
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
accept that yeah I I think I can accept
 

2047
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,550
accept that yeah I I think I can accept
that if I've changed the source code to

2048
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
that if I've changed the source code to
 

2049
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,270
that if I've changed the source code to
my project I've got a different output

2050
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,280
my project I've got a different output
 

2051
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,870
my project I've got a different output
but there's a there's an almost

2052
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
but there's a there's an almost
 

2053
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,550
but there's a there's an almost
philosophical question here if you have

2054
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:20,560
philosophical question here if you have
 

2055
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,030
philosophical question here if you have
two ver if you have a version Python 376

2056
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
two ver if you have a version Python 376
 

2057
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,910
two ver if you have a version Python 376
built with this version of C and Python

2058
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
built with this version of C and Python
 

2059
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,990
built with this version of C and Python
376 version with a built with a

2060
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,000
376 version with a built with a
 

2061
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,390
376 version with a built with a
different version of C are they the same

2062
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,400
different version of C are they the same
 

2063
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,230
different version of C are they the same
Python 376 no nick say not nick says no

2064
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:37,240
Python 376 no nick say not nick says no
 

2065
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,349
Python 376 no nick say not nick says no
yes and you know that's the

2066
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
yes and you know that's the
 

2067
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,470
yes and you know that's the
philosophically I think that's the

2068
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:41,480
philosophically I think that's the
 

2069
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,069
philosophically I think that's the
principled answer right because in fact

2070
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:44,079
principled answer right because in fact
 

2071
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,790
principled answer right because in fact
it could be that there's a bug in in uh

2072
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
it could be that there's a bug in in uh
 

2073
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,470
it could be that there's a bug in in uh
GCC or or uh or whatever C compiler

2074
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:50,480
GCC or or uh or whatever C compiler
 

2075
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,990
GCC or or uh or whatever C compiler
you're using slightly different behavior

2076
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,000
you're using slightly different behavior
 

2077
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,550
you're using slightly different behavior
yeah yeah exactly yeah they I think the

2078
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:56,560
yeah yeah exactly yeah they I think the
 

2079
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,870
yeah yeah exactly yeah they I think the
realistic answer is yes they're the same

2080
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
realistic answer is yes they're the same
 

2081
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,589
realistic answer is yes they're the same
until you're the poor poor muppet that's

2082
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:01,599
until you're the poor poor muppet that's
 

2083
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,990
until you're the poor poor muppet that's
trying to debug the difference exactly

2084
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
trying to debug the difference exactly
 

2085
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,230
trying to debug the difference exactly
yeah yeah yeah you don't want to be that

2086
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
yeah yeah yeah you don't want to be that
 

2087
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,550
yeah yeah yeah you don't want to be that
guy yeah yeah that's right

2088
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:10,560
guy yeah yeah that's right
 

2089
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,190
guy yeah yeah that's right
so this I mean this

2090
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:14,200
so this I mean this
 

2091
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,630
so this I mean this
raises one question I wanted to get in

2092
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:16,640
raises one question I wanted to get in
 

2093
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,030
raises one question I wanted to get in
from that is because I don't know what

2094
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,040
from that is because I don't know what
 

2095
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,589
from that is because I don't know what
the current state of this

2096
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:20,599
the current state of this
 

2097
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,589
the current state of this
is i

2098
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:22,599
is i
 

2099
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,190
is i
remember five six years ago with Nyx

2100
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,200
remember five six years ago with Nyx
 

2101
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,109
remember five six years ago with Nyx
there being a slight problem in that it

2102
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
there being a slight problem in that it
 

2103
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,150
there being a slight problem in that it
worked brilliantly on Nyx OS and Linux

2104
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
worked brilliantly on Nyx OS and Linux
 

2105
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,670
worked brilliantly on Nyx OS and Linux
it didn't work as well on Macs because

2106
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:33,680
it didn't work as well on Macs because
 

2107
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,589
it didn't work as well on Macs because
the funding for build machines because

2108
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:35,599
the funding for build machines because
 

2109
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,750
the funding for build machines because
it's an open source project right and

2110
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:37,760
it's an open source project right and
 

2111
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,150
it's an open source project right and
you need a whole farm of Macs to build

2112
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,160
you need a whole farm of Macs to build
 

2113
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,470
you need a whole farm of Macs to build
the caches up

2114
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:42,480
the caches up
 

2115
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,470
the caches up
what's the state but now that's I should

2116
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,480
what's the state but now that's I should
 

2117
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,069
what's the state but now that's I should
say for the record now that's much

2118
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:46,079
say for the record now that's much
 

2119
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,069
say for the record now that's much
better and it works perfectly for me on

2120
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:48,079
better and it works perfectly for me on
 

2121
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,230
better and it works perfectly for me on
OSX what's the state of Nix on Windows

2122
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,240
OSX what's the state of Nix on Windows
 

2123
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,990
OSX what's the state of Nix on Windows
uh I think I I think there's like very

2124
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000
uh I think I I think there's like very
 

2125
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,910
uh I think I I think there's like very
um to be honest I don't have a very good

2126
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:57,920
um to be honest I don't have a very good
 

2127
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,950
um to be honest I don't have a very good
sense um the truth is neither I nor

2128
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:00,960
sense um the truth is neither I nor
 

2129
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,470
sense um the truth is neither I nor
anyone I know develop on on Windows

2130
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:04,480
anyone I know develop on on Windows
 

2131
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,950
anyone I know develop on on Windows
uh we'll have to leave that for the

2132
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
uh we'll have to leave that for the
 

2133
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,910
uh we'll have to leave that for the
comment section then

2134
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:08,920
comment section then
 

2135
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,430
comment section then
yes there there is I think you know

2136
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440
yes there there is I think you know
 

2137
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,829
yes there there is I think you know
efforts to support uh Windows and and

2138
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
efforts to support uh Windows and and
 

2139
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,470
efforts to support uh Windows and and
there's always W is Windows subsystem

2140
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:18,480
there's always W is Windows subsystem
 

2141
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,030
there's always W is Windows subsystem
for Linux and whatnot that u that do

2142
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,040
for Linux and whatnot that u that do
 

2143
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,030
for Linux and whatnot that u that do
allow you to use uh Nyx via WSL um but I

2144
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
allow you to use uh Nyx via WSL um but I
 

2145
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,230
allow you to use uh Nyx via WSL um but I
don't know what the experience is like

2146
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
don't know what the experience is like
 

2147
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,069
don't know what the experience is like
right i think that that's really a very

2148
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:30,079
right i think that that's really a very
 

2149
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,390
right i think that that's really a very
important question is is what does it

2150
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:32,400
important question is is what does it
 

2151
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,589
important question is is what does it
feel like when you actually try using it

2152
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:34,599
feel like when you actually try using it
 

2153
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,470
feel like when you actually try using it
how and I have no idea yeah actually

2154
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
how and I have no idea yeah actually
 

2155
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,550
how and I have no idea yeah actually
that so we'll we'll have to we'll have

2156
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
that so we'll we'll have to we'll have
 

2157
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,150
that so we'll we'll have to we'll have
to find another way to get information

2158
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
to find another way to get information
 

2159
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,910
to find another way to get information
but that does lead into something I've

2160
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:44,920
but that does lead into something I've
 

2161
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,990
but that does lead into something I've
experienced using Nyx it feels a lot

2162
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,000
experienced using Nyx it feels a lot
 

2163
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,750
experienced using Nyx it feels a lot
more like I'm running software on my

2164
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
more like I'm running software on my
 

2165
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,910
more like I'm running software on my
computer as opposed to I'm running a

2166
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
computer as opposed to I'm running a
 

2167
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,270
computer as opposed to I'm running a
virtual machine on my computer yeah yeah

2168
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,280
virtual machine on my computer yeah yeah
 

2169
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,470
virtual machine on my computer yeah yeah
that's right um I I mentioned a lot you

2170
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
that's right um I I mentioned a lot you
 

2171
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,109
that's right um I I mentioned a lot you
know these the sandboxing right and then

2172
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
know these the sandboxing right and then
 

2173
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,750
know these the sandboxing right and then
and that's in the in the build process

2174
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,760
and that's in the in the build process
 

2175
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,750
and that's in the in the build process
you do you do want to sandbox things and

2176
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
you do you do want to sandbox things and
 

2177
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,589
you do you do want to sandbox things and
kind of isolate them from the rest of

2178
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:07,599
kind of isolate them from the rest of
 

2179
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,670
kind of isolate them from the rest of
your computer but once you have that

2180
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:09,680
your computer but once you have that
 

2181
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,470
your computer but once you have that
binary you can now safely use it as if

2182
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
binary you can now safely use it as if
 

2183
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,750
binary you can now safely use it as if
it were any other binary in your

2184
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:13,760
it were any other binary in your
 

2185
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,589
it were any other binary in your
computer whereas with docker usually you

2186
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
computer whereas with docker usually you
 

2187
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,870
computer whereas with docker usually you
know you build something and then you

2188
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
know you build something and then you
 

2189
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,030
know you build something and then you
continue use running it you know if you

2190
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,040
continue use running it you know if you
 

2191
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,550
continue use running it you know if you
have a python version or whatever it is

2192
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
have a python version or whatever it is
 

2193
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,150
have a python version or whatever it is
with certain dependencies and it's still

2194
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,160
with certain dependencies and it's still
 

2195
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,589
with certain dependencies and it's still
running inside the docker container

2196
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
running inside the docker container
 

2197
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,030
running inside the docker container
right yeah it's not just the it's not

2198
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,040
right yeah it's not just the it's not
 

2199
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,790
right yeah it's not just the it's not
not just getting the Python versions

2200
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
not just getting the Python versions
 

2201
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,990
not just getting the Python versions
even after that you have to continue

2202
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,000
even after that you have to continue
 

2203
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,470
even after that you have to continue
using Docker and so and then when you

2204
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:32,480
using Docker and so and then when you
 

2205
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,950
using Docker and so and then when you
you know when you want something when

2206
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:34,960
you know when you want something when
 

2207
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,470
you know when you want something when
you want to communicate with that it's

2208
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
you want to communicate with that it's
 

2209
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,870
you want to communicate with that it's
always a bit more of a hassle or a lot

2210
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
always a bit more of a hassle or a lot
 

2211
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,870
always a bit more of a hassle or a lot
more of a hassle whereas with Nyx you

2212
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:40,880
more of a hassle whereas with Nyx you
 

2213
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,670
more of a hassle whereas with Nyx you
really you know you really can just pipe

2214
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
really you know you really can just pipe
 

2215
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,990
really you know you really can just pipe
things call them as in a bash script or

2216
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,000
things call them as in a bash script or
 

2217
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,710
things call them as in a bash script or
whatever it is right and yeah yeah you

2218
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
whatever it is right and yeah yeah you
 

2219
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,790
whatever it is right and yeah yeah you
don't end up with Nyx doesn't have an

2220
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:50,800
don't end up with Nyx doesn't have an
 

2221
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,030
don't end up with Nyx doesn't have an
equivalent of docker compose right no No

2222
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
equivalent of docker compose right no No
 

2223
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,710
equivalent of docker compose right no No
and maybe I should get you to explain

2224
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:56,720
and maybe I should get you to explain
 

2225
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,790
and maybe I should get you to explain
why it doesn't need one

2226
00:44:59,790 --> 00:44:59,800
why it doesn't need one
 

2227
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,069
why it doesn't need one
uh fundamentally it's it really is

2228
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
uh fundamentally it's it really is
 

2229
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,990
uh fundamentally it's it really is
because you know in some sense um these

2230
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,000
because you know in some sense um these
 

2231
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,430
because you know in some sense um these
um again you know when you're thinking

2232
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:09,440
um again you know when you're thinking
 

2233
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,470
um again you know when you're thinking
about infrastructure when you're

2234
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:10,480
about infrastructure when you're
 

2235
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,910
about infrastructure when you're
thinking of large scale infrastructure

2236
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
thinking of large scale infrastructure
 

2237
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,829
thinking of large scale infrastructure
and deploying it to multiple servers

2238
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:13,839
and deploying it to multiple servers
 

2239
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,030
and deploying it to multiple servers
then of course there's a question of

2240
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,040
then of course there's a question of
 

2241
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,950
then of course there's a question of
like how do you how do you coordinate

2242
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:16,960
like how do you how do you coordinate
 

2243
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,950
like how do you how do you coordinate
how do you organize capture that

2244
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
how do you organize capture that
 

2245
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,510
how do you organize capture that
infrastructure uh declaratively right

2246
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:21,520
infrastructure uh declaratively right
 

2247
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,710
infrastructure uh declaratively right
and that's one thing that people use

2248
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:22,720
and that's one thing that people use
 

2249
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,190
and that's one thing that people use
docker compose for but they also use it

2250
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
docker compose for but they also use it
 

2251
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,030
docker compose for but they also use it
locally right um and that part is

2252
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,040
locally right um and that part is
 

2253
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,190
locally right um and that part is
necessary index because you don't need

2254
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
necessary index because you don't need
 

2255
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,470
necessary index because you don't need
to be spinning up several docker images

2256
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:34,480
to be spinning up several docker images
 

2257
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,630
to be spinning up several docker images
to run specific versions to run your

2258
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:36,640
to run specific versions to run your
 

2259
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,550
to run specific versions to run your
back end your database or whatever it is

2260
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:38,560
back end your database or whatever it is
 

2261
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,430
back end your database or whatever it is
right you can just run them in the same

2262
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
right you can just run them in the same
 

2263
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,510
right you can just run them in the same
ambient environment um yeah you're

2264
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:45,520
ambient environment um yeah you're
 

2265
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,670
ambient environment um yeah you're
running Postgress as though a local

2266
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:47,680
running Postgress as though a local
 

2267
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,950
running Postgress as though a local
binary rather than a separate virtual

2268
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:50,960
binary rather than a separate virtual
 

2269
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,470
binary rather than a separate virtual
machine that connects to your source

2270
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,480
machine that connects to your source
 

2271
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,589
machine that connects to your source
codes virtual machine and Right yeah

2272
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:55,599
codes virtual machine and Right yeah
 

2273
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,109
codes virtual machine and Right yeah
yeah

2274
00:45:58,109 --> 00:45:58,119
yeah
 

2275
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:01,910
yeah
so I mean I've been I was sold into Nyx

2276
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:01,920
so I mean I've been I was sold into Nyx
 

2277
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,470
so I mean I've been I was sold into Nyx
but I've been a convert for years and I

2278
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,480
but I've been a convert for years and I
 

2279
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,829
but I've been a convert for years and I
use it for all my projects but but you

2280
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
use it for all my projects but but you
 

2281
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,309
use it for all my projects but but you
have gone further you've been uh you've

2282
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
have gone further you've been uh you've
 

2283
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,550
have gone further you've been uh you've
been sold into it to the extent that you

2284
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:12,560
been sold into it to the extent that you
 

2285
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,190
been sold into it to the extent that you
want to build a whole service around Nyx

2286
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
want to build a whole service around Nyx
 

2287
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,910
want to build a whole service around Nyx
that's right yeah so what's missing in

2288
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:17,920
that's right yeah so what's missing in
 

2289
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,910
that's right yeah so what's missing in
the world of Nyx that you felt the urge

2290
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:19,920
the world of Nyx that you felt the urge
 

2291
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,829
the world of Nyx that you felt the urge
to build

2292
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:21,839
to build
 

2293
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,710
to build
i think actually quite a lot um in some

2294
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720
i think actually quite a lot um in some
 

2295
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,230
i think actually quite a lot um in some
sense this is what's missing in Nyx you

2296
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,240
sense this is what's missing in Nyx you
 

2297
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,349
sense this is what's missing in Nyx you
know to make the experience of Nyx users

2298
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:29,359
know to make the experience of Nyx users
 

2299
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,230
know to make the experience of Nyx users
uh better um but in some sense it's also

2300
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
uh better um but in some sense it's also
 

2301
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,349
uh better um but in some sense it's also
you know like it kind of feels like when

2302
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:35,359
you know like it kind of feels like when
 

2303
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,349
you know like it kind of feels like when
I think about Nyx right like it's

2304
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:37,359
I think about Nyx right like it's
 

2305
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,790
I think about Nyx right like it's
already a relatively old project but

2306
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800
already a relatively old project but
 

2307
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,670
already a relatively old project but
when I think about Nyx uh the adoption

2308
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:41,680
when I think about Nyx uh the adoption
 

2309
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,550
when I think about Nyx uh the adoption
isn't it's not the the industry standard

2310
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:44,560
isn't it's not the the industry standard
 

2311
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,870
isn't it's not the the industry standard
yet in the way that Docker is no um and

2312
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:48,880
yet in the way that Docker is no um and
 

2313
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,870
yet in the way that Docker is no um and
it feels a bit like discovering inks

2314
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
it feels a bit like discovering inks
 

2315
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,390
it feels a bit like discovering inks
feels a bit like uh you know discovering

2316
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
feels a bit like uh you know discovering
 

2317
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,750
feels a bit like uh you know discovering
a garden uh where there hasn't been

2318
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:57,760
a garden uh where there hasn't been
 

2319
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,950
a garden uh where there hasn't been
anyone you know like an full of apple

2320
00:46:59,950 --> 00:46:59,960
anyone you know like an full of apple
 

2321
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,790
anyone you know like an full of apple
trees there hasn't been anyone who saw

2322
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
trees there hasn't been anyone who saw
 

2323
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,630
trees there hasn't been anyone who saw
this and you know this is not like it's

2324
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:04,640
this and you know this is not like it's
 

2325
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,390
this and you know this is not like it's
like somewhere off in the corner and not

2326
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:06,400
like somewhere off in the corner and not
 

2327
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,910
like somewhere off in the corner and not
the main thoroughfare so when you go

2328
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:07,920
the main thoroughfare so when you go
 

2329
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,510
the main thoroughfare so when you go
there all the trees are really laden

2330
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:09,520
there all the trees are really laden
 

2331
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,270
there all the trees are really laden
with fruit and you can really pluck the

2332
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
with fruit and you can really pluck the
 

2333
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,870
with fruit and you can really pluck the
the low hanging fruits without any

2334
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:12,880
the low hanging fruits without any
 

2335
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,550
the low hanging fruits without any
effort right there's so many benefits

2336
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:14,560
effort right there's so many benefits
 

2337
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,069
effort right there's so many benefits
that that people haven't yet um explored

2338
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:18,079
that that people haven't yet um explored
 

2339
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,630
that that people haven't yet um explored
and investigated to their full extent um

2340
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
and investigated to their full extent um
 

2341
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,829
and investigated to their full extent um
in in that sort of paradigm

2342
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:22,839
in in that sort of paradigm
 

2343
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,829
in in that sort of paradigm
shift and and that's one of the things

2344
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
shift and and that's one of the things
 

2345
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,589
shift and and that's one of the things
that really excites me right like I

2346
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:28,599
that really excites me right like I
 

2347
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,230
that really excites me right like I
think an example uh so two two big

2348
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
think an example uh so two two big
 

2349
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,550
think an example uh so two two big
examples is you know like uh how much

2350
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:34,560
examples is you know like uh how much
 

2351
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,230
examples is you know like uh how much
better CI can be if we base it um based

2352
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,240
better CI can be if we base it um based
 

2353
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,430
better CI can be if we base it um based
it on nyx instead of uh anything else uh

2354
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:41,440
it on nyx instead of uh anything else uh
 

2355
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,430
it on nyx instead of uh anything else uh
how much faster how much easier

2356
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
how much faster how much easier
 

2357
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,349
how much faster how much easier
how much more reliable but then another

2358
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
how much more reliable but then another
 

2359
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,950
how much more reliable but then another
is u you know how how much better our

2360
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
is u you know how how much better our
 

2361
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,550
is u you know how how much better our
deployment infrastructure can be right

2362
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:50,560
deployment infrastructure can be right
 

2363
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,270
deployment infrastructure can be right
so that we can really um abstract away

2364
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
so that we can really um abstract away
 

2365
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,349
so that we can really um abstract away
ideas such as you know like having three

2366
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
ideas such as you know like having three
 

2367
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,589
ideas such as you know like having three
server three postquest servers servers

2368
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
server three postquest servers servers
 

2369
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,150
server three postquest servers servers
with redundancy and failover or whatnot

2370
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,160
with redundancy and failover or whatnot
 

2371
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,109
with redundancy and failover or whatnot
how we can get zero downtime deployments

2372
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
how we can get zero downtime deployments
 

2373
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,510
how we can get zero downtime deployments
really easily atomic upgrades so that

2374
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:05,520
really easily atomic upgrades so that
 

2375
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,910
really easily atomic upgrades so that
you know different web servers don't

2376
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:07,920
you know different web servers don't
 

2377
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,030
you know different web servers don't
need to um worry about being back

2378
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
need to um worry about being back
 

2379
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,790
need to um worry about being back
staying backwards compatible or forwards

2380
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:12,800
staying backwards compatible or forwards
 

2381
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,950
staying backwards compatible or forwards
compatibility which is a huge when you

2382
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:14,960
compatibility which is a huge when you
 

2383
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,230
compatibility which is a huge when you
know developing um uh all of these

2384
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
know developing um uh all of these
 

2385
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,069
know developing um uh all of these
things you know like once you sort of

2386
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:20,079
things you know like once you sort of
 

2387
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,030
things you know like once you sort of
start thinking in terms of the basic uh

2388
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,040
start thinking in terms of the basic uh
 

2389
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,270
start thinking in terms of the basic uh
conceptual infrastructure of Nyx uh all

2390
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
conceptual infrastructure of Nyx uh all
 

2391
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,109
conceptual infrastructure of Nyx uh all
of these things become possible right so

2392
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119
of these things become possible right so
 

2393
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,430
of these things become possible right so
so partly it's you know solving an

2394
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
so partly it's you know solving an
 

2395
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,790
so partly it's you know solving an
existing problem for Nyx users um

2396
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:31,800
existing problem for Nyx users um
 

2397
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,750
existing problem for Nyx users um
namely

2398
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:34,760
namely
 

2399
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,109
namely
um the situation is a little bit like

2400
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:37,119
um the situation is a little bit like
 

2401
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,069
um the situation is a little bit like
you know get before GitHub right like

2402
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:39,079
you know get before GitHub right like
 

2403
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:41,870
you know get before GitHub right like
GitHub came along

2404
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:41,880
GitHub came along
 

2405
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,710
GitHub came along
and

2406
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:43,720
and
 

2407
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,990
and
made get much more accessible right

2408
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,000
made get much more accessible right
 

2409
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,910
made get much more accessible right
previously you had to you know you were

2410
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920
previously you had to you know you were
 

2411
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,910
previously you had to you know you were
a Linux kernel kernel developer probably

2412
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:49,920
a Linux kernel kernel developer probably
 

2413
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,630
a Linux kernel kernel developer probably
if you're using it and you had to sort

2414
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:52,640
if you're using it and you had to sort
 

2415
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,950
if you're using it and you had to sort
of format patches and attach them to

2416
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
of format patches and attach them to
 

2417
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,430
of format patches and attach them to
your mail client and then also verify

2418
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:57,440
your mail client and then also verify
 

2419
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,670
your mail client and then also verify
the signatures and use GPG and whatever

2420
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,680
the signatures and use GPG and whatever
 

2421
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,750
the signatures and use GPG and whatever
it was it was you know it's a it's a

2422
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:01,760
it was it was you know it's a it's a
 

2423
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,190
it was it was you know it's a it's a
workflow that for a lot of people was

2424
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,200
workflow that for a lot of people was
 

2425
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,670
workflow that for a lot of people was
actually quite enjoyable uh but

2426
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:05,680
actually quite enjoyable uh but
 

2427
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,190
actually quite enjoyable uh but
definitely not for everyone right

2428
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
definitely not for everyone right
 

2429
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,030
definitely not for everyone right
whereas yeah GitHub comes along and

2430
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:09,040
whereas yeah GitHub comes along and
 

2431
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,950
whereas yeah GitHub comes along and
makes this really clear that this is

2432
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:10,960
makes this really clear that this is
 

2433
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,589
makes this really clear that this is
this you know a that version control is

2434
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599
this you know a that version control is
 

2435
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,270
this you know a that version control is
a really good idea and that git is a

2436
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:15,280
a really good idea and that git is a
 

2437
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,270
a really good idea and that git is a
good implementation of it but then also

2438
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,280
good implementation of it but then also
 

2439
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,630
good implementation of it but then also
you know makes this accessible to people

2440
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:18,640
you know makes this accessible to people
 

2441
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,910
you know makes this accessible to people
who aren't developers um and they can

2442
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:21,920
who aren't developers um and they can
 

2443
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,549
who aren't developers um and they can
use this interface and see and see their

2444
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:24,559
use this interface and see and see their
 

2445
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,510
use this interface and see and see their
change directly in the UI make changes

2446
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:27,520
change directly in the UI make changes
 

2447
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,510
change directly in the UI make changes
and I think like this is something that

2448
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:29,520
and I think like this is something that
 

2449
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,829
and I think like this is something that
Nick still needs it needs a company to

2450
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
Nick still needs it needs a company to
 

2451
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,470
Nick still needs it needs a company to
to or several companies hopefully uh to

2452
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:34,480
to or several companies hopefully uh to
 

2453
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,910
to or several companies hopefully uh to
come along and say hey um we can all of

2454
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920
come along and say hey um we can all of
 

2455
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,670
come along and say hey um we can all of
the accidental complexity we can take

2456
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:39,680
the accidental complexity we can take
 

2457
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,829
the accidental complexity we can take
care of right like if you if you want to

2458
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:41,839
care of right like if you if you want to
 

2459
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,470
care of right like if you if you want to
enable CI um it's just one button if you

2460
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,480
enable CI um it's just one button if you
 

2461
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,829
enable CI um it's just one button if you
want to deploy uh you know seven

2462
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:47,839
want to deploy uh you know seven
 

2463
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,470
want to deploy uh you know seven
different servers in two different

2464
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:50,480
different servers in two different
 

2465
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,390
different servers in two different
environments that's also you know like

2466
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:52,400
environments that's also you know like
 

2467
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,950
environments that's also you know like
two or three lines of code um and that

2468
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
two or three lines of code um and that
 

2469
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,190
two or three lines of code um and that
will really

2470
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,200
will really
 

2471
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,670
will really
um potentially potentially even

2472
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,680
um potentially potentially even
 

2473
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,030
um potentially potentially even
abstracting away some of the experience

2474
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,040
abstracting away some of the experience
 

2475
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,309
abstracting away some of the experience
of using Nyx itself so that you know um

2476
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
of using Nyx itself so that you know um
 

2477
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,630
of using Nyx itself so that you know um
this this becomes that so that we can

2478
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:06,640
this this becomes that so that we can
 

2479
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,549
this this becomes that so that we can
benefit from the conceptual advances

2480
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559
benefit from the conceptual advances
 

2481
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,349
benefit from the conceptual advances
that Nyx brings without the admittedly

2482
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:11,359
that Nyx brings without the admittedly
 

2483
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,910
that Nyx brings without the admittedly
quite high um barrier to entry give me

2484
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:15,920
quite high um barrier to entry give me
 

2485
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,910
quite high um barrier to entry give me
an example of how that works cuz it's

2486
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
an example of how that works cuz it's
 

2487
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,069
an example of how that works cuz it's
like I feel I remember there being a

2488
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
like I feel I remember there being a
 

2489
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,030
like I feel I remember there being a
project called Nyx Ops right yeah which

2490
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,040
project called Nyx Ops right yeah which
 

2491
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,910
project called Nyx Ops right yeah which
was attempting to say we can describe

2492
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:25,920
was attempting to say we can describe
 

2493
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,910
was attempting to say we can describe
infrastructure using this same language

2494
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
infrastructure using this same language
 

2495
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,109
infrastructure using this same language
you're using to describe builds yeah

2496
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:31,119
you're using to describe builds yeah
 

2497
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,750
you're using to describe builds yeah
yeah but that

2498
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:32,760
yeah but that
 

2499
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,750
yeah but that
project I think died for lack of support

2500
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:35,760
project I think died for lack of support
 

2501
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,750
project I think died for lack of support
i don't think it's still going that's

2502
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,760
i don't think it's still going that's
 

2503
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,829
i don't think it's still going that's
right um it's not fully dead um but but

2504
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:41,839
right um it's not fully dead um but but
 

2505
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,109
right um it's not fully dead um but but
it's nearly uh are you taking up the

2506
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:45,119
it's nearly uh are you taking up the
 

2507
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,190
it's nearly uh are you taking up the
mantle of that core idea which is we

2508
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,200
mantle of that core idea which is we
 

2509
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,390
mantle of that core idea which is we
shouldn't have a separate language for

2510
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:48,400
shouldn't have a separate language for
 

2511
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,829
shouldn't have a separate language for
builds and a separate language for

2512
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:49,839
builds and a separate language for
 

2513
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,309
builds and a separate language for
deployment infrastructure

2514
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
deployment infrastructure
 

2515
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,069
deployment infrastructure
uh somewhat I think that that idea has

2516
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
uh somewhat I think that that idea has
 

2517
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,470
uh somewhat I think that that idea has
already pervaded some of the way in

2518
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
already pervaded some of the way in
 

2519
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,109
already pervaded some of the way in
which in which uh people use Nyx right

2520
00:50:59,109 --> 00:50:59,119
which in which uh people use Nyx right
 

2521
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,710
which in which uh people use Nyx right
so Nyx has this agenda let's call it

2522
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,720
so Nyx has this agenda let's call it
 

2523
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,710
so Nyx has this agenda let's call it
called flakes which is a sort of a

2524
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:04,720
called flakes which is a sort of a
 

2525
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,150
called flakes which is a sort of a
standardized way of

2526
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:07,160
standardized way of
 

2527
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,390
standardized way of
um of organizing your project

2528
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:11,400
um of organizing your project
 

2529
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,230
um of organizing your project
um and uh and that means you know like

2530
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:16,240
um and uh and that means you know like
 

2531
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,670
um and uh and that means you know like
you know next to language allows you to

2532
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:17,680
you know next to language allows you to
 

2533
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,349
you know next to language allows you to
to build things but you know

2534
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:20,359
to build things but you know
 

2535
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:22,790
to build things but you know
pro you probably want to separate you

2536
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
pro you probably want to separate you
 

2537
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,510
pro you probably want to separate you
know the packages from the tests and

2538
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
know the packages from the tests and
 

2539
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,990
know the packages from the tests and
make clear to people what it is that uh

2540
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,000
make clear to people what it is that uh
 

2541
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,589
make clear to people what it is that uh
those are and have a standardized way of

2542
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:29,599
those are and have a standardized way of
 

2543
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,670
those are and have a standardized way of
saying I want to run the Mac tests

2544
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:31,680
saying I want to run the Mac tests
 

2545
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,870
saying I want to run the Mac tests
because I'm on a Mac rather than the the

2546
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:34,880
because I'm on a Mac rather than the the
 

2547
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,390
because I'm on a Mac rather than the the
Linux uh Intel ones

2548
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:39,400
Linux uh Intel ones
 

2549
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,549
Linux uh Intel ones
and and you know sort of specify again

2550
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:42,559
and and you know sort of specify again
 

2551
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,270
and and you know sort of specify again
in a sort of like very simple key value

2552
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:45,280
in a sort of like very simple key value
 

2553
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,990
in a sort of like very simple key value
way almost um what the dev shells of

2554
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
way almost um what the dev shells of
 

2555
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,150
way almost um what the dev shells of
this project are right so so fakes is is

2556
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,160
this project are right so so fakes is is
 

2557
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,870
this project are right so so fakes is is
is

2558
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:51,880
is
 

2559
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,190
is
um is has become um a somewhat

2560
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:55,200
um is has become um a somewhat
 

2561
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,710
um is has become um a somewhat
controversial but also de facto standard

2562
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:58,720
controversial but also de facto standard
 

2563
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,630
controversial but also de facto standard
um for how you organize your your your

2564
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:02,640
um for how you organize your your your
 

2565
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,390
um for how you organize your your your
projects yeah you've you've you've raced

2566
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
projects yeah you've you've you've raced
 

2567
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,829
projects yeah you've you've you've raced
past that one point i'm going to

2568
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:07,839
past that one point i'm going to
 

2569
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,150
past that one point i'm going to
emphasize it it's very nice to have as

2570
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
emphasize it it's very nice to have as
 

2571
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,109
emphasize it it's very nice to have as
well as like a a script that defines how

2572
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:13,119
well as like a a script that defines how
 

2573
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,349
well as like a a script that defines how
to build it also says these are the

2574
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:15,359
to build it also says these are the
 

2575
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,030
to build it also says these are the
tools you'll want available in the shell

2576
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040
tools you'll want available in the shell
 

2577
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,390
tools you'll want available in the shell
when you're developing yeah yeah that's

2578
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:20,400
when you're developing yeah yeah that's
 

2579
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,430
when you're developing yeah yeah that's
a really nice angle of that yeah yeah

2580
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:23,440
a really nice angle of that yeah yeah
 

2581
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,190
a really nice angle of that yeah yeah
the dev shell as you mentioned sorry

2582
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
the dev shell as you mentioned sorry
 

2583
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,549
the dev shell as you mentioned sorry
carry on yeah

2584
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:27,559
carry on yeah
 

2585
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:32,069
carry on yeah
uh so so they're um so they I think the

2586
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:32,079
uh so so they're um so they I think the
 

2587
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,430
uh so so they're um so they I think the
the majority of of new projects by far

2588
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:35,440
the majority of of new projects by far
 

2589
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,309
the majority of of new projects by far
um use this this sort of uh use flakes

2590
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
um use this this sort of uh use flakes
 

2591
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,990
um use this this sort of uh use flakes
and

2592
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,000
and
 

2593
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,710
and
um and they allow you to specify uh also

2594
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
um and they allow you to specify uh also
 

2595
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,870
um and they allow you to specify uh also
Nexos machines which I mean as we

2596
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:46,880
Nexos machines which I mean as we
 

2597
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,349
Nexos machines which I mean as we
mentioned you know you can have entire

2598
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:49,359
mentioned you know you can have entire
 

2599
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,270
mentioned you know you can have entire
uh Nexos systems built on Nyx um which

2600
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,280
uh Nexos systems built on Nyx um which
 

2601
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,349
uh Nexos systems built on Nyx um which
can you can run locally in VMs or which

2602
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
can you can run locally in VMs or which
 

2603
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,670
can you can run locally in VMs or which
you can deploy Okay um and so what we do

2604
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:57,680
you can deploy Okay um and so what we do
 

2605
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,670
you can deploy Okay um and so what we do
is say okay like well given that you

2606
00:52:59,670 --> 00:52:59,680
is say okay like well given that you
 

2607
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,270
is say okay like well given that you
probably are already writing all of

2608
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,280
probably are already writing all of
 

2609
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,870
probably are already writing all of
these things um if you're um if you're

2610
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:04,880
these things um if you're um if you're
 

2611
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,750
these things um if you're um if you're
coming if you're nicksavvy uh there are

2612
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:07,760
coming if you're nicksavvy uh there are
 

2613
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,950
coming if you're nicksavvy uh there are
options if you're not Nicksavvy

2614
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:09,960
options if you're not Nicksavvy
 

2615
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,630
options if you're not Nicksavvy
but if you've already written this what

2616
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
but if you've already written this what
 

2617
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,390
but if you've already written this what
we say is okay we'll just build all

2618
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
we say is okay we'll just build all
 

2619
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,750
we say is okay we'll just build all
these things without you having to

2620
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
these things without you having to
 

2621
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,270
these things without you having to
specify any more details we'll just

2622
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,280
specify any more details we'll just
 

2623
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,109
specify any more details we'll just
build all your packages and and checks

2624
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:19,119
build all your packages and and checks
 

2625
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,069
build all your packages and and checks
on CI and if you say I want to deploy

2626
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
on CI and if you say I want to deploy
 

2627
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,589
on CI and if you say I want to deploy
these seven servers or these five

2628
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
these seven servers or these five
 

2629
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,670
these seven servers or these five
servers we'll also deploy those servers

2630
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
servers we'll also deploy those servers
 

2631
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,510
servers we'll also deploy those servers
for you right so so we're not coming up

2632
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:27,520
for you right so so we're not coming up
 

2633
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,790
for you right so so we're not coming up
with a new uh idea about how to

2634
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:31,800
with a new uh idea about how to
 

2635
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,430
with a new uh idea about how to
um about how to

2636
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:34,440
um about how to
 

2637
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,790
um about how to
uh this uh how to deploy and and specify

2638
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:38,800
uh this uh how to deploy and and specify
 

2639
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,510
uh this uh how to deploy and and specify
uh large scale infrastructure in Nyx

2640
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,520
uh large scale infrastructure in Nyx
 

2641
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,349
uh large scale infrastructure in Nyx
because this has already been there are

2642
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:43,359
because this has already been there are
 

2643
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,390
because this has already been there are
some already accepted practices in that

2644
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,400
some already accepted practices in that
 

2645
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,950
some already accepted practices in that
regard we're just making it automatic

2646
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:48,960
regard we're just making it automatic
 

2647
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,349
regard we're just making it automatic
right so it's a it's a a platform as a

2648
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:51,359
right so it's a it's a a platform as a
 

2649
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,430
right so it's a it's a a platform as a
service right like you push to to GitHub

2650
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:53,440
service right like you push to to GitHub
 

2651
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,230
service right like you push to to GitHub
and we run all your tests and we deploy

2652
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,240
and we run all your tests and we deploy
 

2653
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,950
and we run all your tests and we deploy
um automatically so kind of the ease

2654
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:58,960
um automatically so kind of the ease
 

2655
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,030
um automatically so kind of the ease
that you might expect from from Heroku

2656
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,040
that you might expect from from Heroku
 

2657
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,349
that you might expect from from Heroku
or something like that but with a Nyx an

2658
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:03,359
or something like that but with a Nyx an
 

2659
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,549
or something like that but with a Nyx an
entirely Nyx based system is the trick

2660
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:06,559
entirely Nyx based system is the trick
 

2661
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,069
entirely Nyx based system is the trick
here

2662
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:09,079
here
 

2663
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,630
here
that is the trick that a Docker file is

2664
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,640
that is the trick that a Docker file is
 

2665
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,109
that is the trick that a Docker file is
more like a bash script than anything

2666
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:15,119
more like a bash script than anything
 

2667
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,190
more like a bash script than anything
right and you you

2668
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:18,200
right and you you
 

2669
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,670
right and you you
can't you can't really like build the

2670
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:21,680
can't you can't really like build the
 

2671
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,910
can't you can't really like build the
syntax tree and do compile time analysis

2672
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:25,920
syntax tree and do compile time analysis
 

2673
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,910
syntax tree and do compile time analysis
in the same way in a Docker file that

2674
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:27,920
in the same way in a Docker file that
 

2675
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,549
in the same way in a Docker file that
you could on NYX the language and what

2676
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
you could on NYX the language and what
 

2677
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,470
you could on NYX the language and what
you're doing is saying we can peer into

2678
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:32,480
you're doing is saying we can peer into
 

2679
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,829
you're doing is saying we can peer into
this language and peer into these

2680
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
this language and peer into these
 

2681
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,510
this language and peer into these
specifications and figure out what

2682
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,520
specifications and figure out what
 

2683
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,910
specifications and figure out what
they're trying to do and use reuse that

2684
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:39,920
they're trying to do and use reuse that
 

2685
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,710
they're trying to do and use reuse that
machine language for a different purpose

2686
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:42,720
machine language for a different purpose
 

2687
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,710
machine language for a different purpose
the purpose of deployment absolutely and

2688
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
the purpose of deployment absolutely and
 

2689
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,270
the purpose of deployment absolutely and
and and it's beautiful like I I I really

2690
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
and and it's beautiful like I I I really
 

2691
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,750
and and it's beautiful like I I I really
get a lot of joy from thinking through

2692
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:49,760
get a lot of joy from thinking through
 

2693
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,750
get a lot of joy from thinking through
the various ways in which this this is

2694
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:51,760
the various ways in which this this is
 

2695
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,829
the various ways in which this this is
such a beautiful idea and concept right

2696
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:53,839
such a beautiful idea and concept right
 

2697
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,430
such a beautiful idea and concept right
like one of the things that's really

2698
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
like one of the things that's really
 

2699
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,510
like one of the things that's really
great is you can actually see you know

2700
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,520
great is you can actually see you know
 

2701
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,030
great is you can actually see you know
because because you can peer into the

2702
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
because because you can peer into the
 

2703
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,990
because because you can peer into the
structure as you say um you can say

2704
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:02,000
structure as you say um you can say
 

2705
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,390
structure as you say um you can say
things like oh what what is my my

2706
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:04,400
things like oh what what is my my
 

2707
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,910
things like oh what what is my my

2709
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,910

the versions you know let's say that uh

2712
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,200
the versions you know let's say that uh
 

2713
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,870
the versions you know let's say that uh
uh uh we know about a CVE that just came

2714
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:16,880
uh uh we know about a CVE that just came
 

2715
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,349
uh uh we know about a CVE that just came
out in Python affecting uh you know this

2716
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:19,359
out in Python affecting uh you know this
 

2717
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,630
out in Python affecting uh you know this
version range i can say okay what uh

2718
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
version range i can say okay what uh
 

2719
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,710
version range i can say okay what uh
what which of m machines have this

2720
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
what which of m machines have this
 

2721
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,470
what which of m machines have this
version of Python installed right uh

00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:26,480
version of Python installed right uh
 

2723
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,750
version of Python installed right uh
anywhere anywhere at all right um so you

2724
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:29,760
anywhere anywhere at all right um so you
 

2725
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,309
anywhere anywhere at all right um so you
can really peer into like into into with

2726
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
can really peer into like into into with
 

2727
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,270
can really peer into like into into with
remarkable detail right and into uh your

2728
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,280
remarkable detail right and into uh your
 

2729
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,549
remarkable detail right and into uh your
entire uh uh infrastructure and really

2730
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
entire uh uh infrastructure and really
 

2731
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,230
entire uh uh infrastructure and really
start you know programming with it right

2732
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
start you know programming with it right
 

2733
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,549
start you know programming with it right
like uh uh coming up with uh uh yeah

2734
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:44,559
like uh uh coming up with uh uh yeah
 

2735
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,510
like uh uh coming up with uh uh yeah
coming up with questions to ask or or

2736
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
coming up with questions to ask or or
 

2737
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,349
coming up with questions to ask or or
ways of automating systems and whatnot

2738
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
ways of automating systems and whatnot
 

2739
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:53,589
ways of automating systems and whatnot
that that really uh well we we talk a

2740
00:55:53,589 --> 00:55:53,599
that that really uh well we we talk a
 

2741
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,069
that that really uh well we we talk a
lot about infrastructure as code we

2742
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:56,079
lot about infrastructure as code we
 

2743
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,069
lot about infrastructure as code we
don't then make the leap to say code as

2744
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,079
don't then make the leap to say code as
 

2745
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,870
don't then make the leap to say code as
source of information we can automate

2746
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:00,880
source of information we can automate
 

2747
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,549
source of information we can automate
further right yeah yeah yeah there is a

2748
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
further right yeah yeah yeah there is a
 

2749
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,829
further right yeah yeah yeah there is a
yeah yeah yeah absolutely

2750
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:06,839
yeah yeah yeah absolutely
 

2751
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,750
yeah yeah yeah absolutely
uh there is this there's this nent idea

2752
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:09,760
uh there is this there's this nent idea
 

2753
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,589
uh there is this there's this nent idea
in in things like puli for instance

2754
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
in in things like puli for instance
 

2755
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,109
in in things like puli for instance
right like we let's use the data

2756
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
right like we let's use the data
 

2757
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,109
right like we let's use the data
structures of of a proper programming

2758
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:15,119
structures of of a proper programming
 

2759
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,150
structures of of a proper programming
language so that uh but there are

2760
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
language so that uh but there are
 

2761
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,190
language so that uh but there are
problems with

2762
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:20,200
problems with
 

2763
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,950
problems with
with with using an existing language

2764
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
with with using an existing language
 

2765
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,950
with with using an existing language
like that to do these things right like

2766
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:25,960
like that to do these things right like
 

2767
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,349
like that to do these things right like
um there isn't there isn't really

2768
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
um there isn't there isn't really
 

2769
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,910
um there isn't there isn't really
clarity about about these structures and

2770
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:31,920
clarity about about these structures and
 

2771
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,349
clarity about about these structures and
running the same script twice might

2772
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:33,359
running the same script twice might
 

2773
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:34,870
running the same script twice might
result in different structures and you

2774
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
result in different structures and you
 

2775
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,910
result in different structures and you
never know and um

2776
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:36,920
never know and um
 

2777
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,990
never know and um
so so it feels again a bit ad hoc even

2778
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:40,000
so so it feels again a bit ad hoc even
 

2779
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,990
so so it feels again a bit ad hoc even
though it recognizes the importance of

2780
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,000
though it recognizes the importance of
 

2781
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,230
though it recognizes the importance of
being able to manipulate uh

2782
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,240
being able to manipulate uh
 

2783
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,470
being able to manipulate uh
your your infrastructure as a data

2784
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:48,480
your your infrastructure as a data
 

2785
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,470
your your infrastructure as a data
structure

2786
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
structure
 

2787
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,870
structure
yeah cuz you

2788
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:51,880
yeah cuz you
 

2789
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,349
yeah cuz you
want it does sort of push if you want to

2790
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
want it does sort of push if you want to
 

2791
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,430
want it does sort of push if you want to
really unlock that it pushes you away

2792
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:57,440
really unlock that it pushes you away
 

2793
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,470
really unlock that it pushes you away
from languages that are inherently

2794
00:56:59,470 --> 00:56:59,480
from languages that are inherently
 

2795
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,670
from languages that are inherently
imperative you want to get more towards

2796
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
imperative you want to get more towards
 

2797
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,910
imperative you want to get more towards
a language that's more like just a big

2798
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:03,920
a language that's more like just a big
 

2799
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,030
a language that's more like just a big
data structure right right yeah which I

2800
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,040
data structure right right yeah which I
 

2801
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,630
data structure right right yeah which I
guess is kind of a trick that Lisp

2802
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
guess is kind of a trick that Lisp
 

2803
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,390
guess is kind of a trick that Lisp
figured out back in the 60s and we keep

2804
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:10,400
figured out back in the 60s and we keep
 

2805
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,030
figured out back in the 60s and we keep
relearning right yeah yeah yeah that's

2806
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,040
relearning right yeah yeah yeah that's
 

2807
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,349
relearning right yeah yeah yeah that's
right yeah

2808
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
right yeah
 

2809
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,349
right yeah
okay

2810
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:16,359
okay
 

2811
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:19,510
okay
so tell tell me so your service for this

2812
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
so tell tell me so your service for this
 

2813
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,309
so tell tell me so your service for this
is called Garnics right yes and I do

2814
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:22,319
is called Garnics right yes and I do
 

2815
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,870
is called Garnics right yes and I do
want to know what state it's in and what

2816
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:24,880
want to know what state it's in and what
 

2817
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,230
want to know what state it's in and what
cuz I'm always interested when

2818
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,240
cuz I'm always interested when
 

2819
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,470
cuz I'm always interested when
programmers get so obsessed they become

2820
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:28,480
programmers get so obsessed they become
 

2821
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,230
programmers get so obsessed they become
like builders of services yeah yeah

2822
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:32,240
like builders of services yeah yeah
 

2823
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,390
like builders of services yeah yeah
what's that road like and is the is

2824
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:34,400
what's that road like and is the is
 

2825
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,150
what's that road like and is the is
there much competition is there much

2826
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:36,160
there much competition is there much
 

2827
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,789
there much competition is there much
uptake how is your life now as not just

2828
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:38,799
uptake how is your life now as not just
 

2829
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:43,910
uptake how is your life now as not just
a fan but a seller of mix yeah yeah yeah

2830
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:43,920
a fan but a seller of mix yeah yeah yeah
 

2831
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,750
a fan but a seller of mix yeah yeah yeah
i think uh you know we've again the way

2832
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
i think uh you know we've again the way
 

2833
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,309
i think uh you know we've again the way
we've been thinking about this is um you

2834
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
we've been thinking about this is um you
 

2835
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,270
we've been thinking about this is um you
know again like building a platform as a

2836
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
know again like building a platform as a
 

2837
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,430
know again like building a platform as a
service based on fundamentally different

2838
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
service based on fundamentally different
 

2839
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,950
service based on fundamentally different
approach based on nyx um has a lot of

2840
00:57:58,950 --> 00:57:58,960
approach based on nyx um has a lot of
 

2841
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,470
approach based on nyx um has a lot of
advantages has enormous

2842
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:01,480
advantages has enormous
 

2843
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,589
advantages has enormous
advantages but one of the things that we

2844
00:58:03,589 --> 00:58:03,599
advantages but one of the things that we
 

2845
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,630
advantages but one of the things that we
also sort of uh took for or a conclusion

2846
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
also sort of uh took for or a conclusion
 

2847
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,510
also sort of uh took for or a conclusion
that we came to is also that um to do a

2848
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
that we came to is also that um to do a
 

2849
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,150
that we came to is also that um to do a
pass to do the CI/CD pipeline you should

2850
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
pass to do the CI/CD pipeline you should
 

2851
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,870
pass to do the CI/CD pipeline you should
really do the CI pipeline very well um

2852
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:16,880
really do the CI pipeline very well um
 

2853
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,030
really do the CI pipeline very well um
and and the reason here is you know when

2854
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,040
and and the reason here is you know when
 

2855
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,670
and and the reason here is you know when
you when you see all these other sort of

2856
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:21,680
you when you see all these other sort of
 

2857
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,990
you when you see all these other sort of
uh companies such as render or fly or

2858
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,000
uh companies such as render or fly or
 

2859
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,750
uh companies such as render or fly or
whatever there's a

2860
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:26,760
whatever there's a
 

2861
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,950
whatever there's a
uh the technique is something like oh if

2862
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
uh the technique is something like oh if
 

2863
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,789
uh the technique is something like oh if
you want to try try us out we'll build

2864
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:30,799
you want to try try us out we'll build
 

2865
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,470
you want to try try us out we'll build
your project using build packs or

2866
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:32,480
your project using build packs or
 

2867
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,710
your project using build packs or
whatever it is um and then deploy it but

2868
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
whatever it is um and then deploy it but
 

2869
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,230
whatever it is um and then deploy it but
usually at some point you'll switch to

2870
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:38,240
usually at some point you'll switch to
 

2871
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,990
usually at some point you'll switch to
GitHub actions for running the tests and

2872
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,000
GitHub actions for running the tests and
 

2873
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,990
GitHub actions for running the tests and
whatnot and then you have to call into

2874
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,000
whatnot and then you have to call into
 

2875
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,910
whatnot and then you have to call into
us and to let us know um to let us know

2876
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:45,920
us and to let us know um to let us know
 

2877
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,069
us and to let us know um to let us know
what it is you built push the binaries

2878
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:48,079
what it is you built push the binaries
 

2879
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,309
what it is you built push the binaries
out and push the the Docker images or

2880
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:50,319
out and push the the Docker images or
 

2881
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,309
out and push the the Docker images or
whatever it is to us but this is kind of

2882
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:52,319
whatever it is to us but this is kind of
 

2883
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,990
whatever it is to us but this is kind of
a narrow waste right like you lose a lot

2884
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,000
a narrow waste right like you lose a lot
 

2885
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,190
a narrow waste right like you lose a lot
of information there's there's one

2886
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:55,200
of information there's there's one
 

2887
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,190
of information there's there's one
component GitHub action say that's doing

2888
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,200
component GitHub action say that's doing
 

2889
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,870
component GitHub action say that's doing
the build and another component that's

2890
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:58,880
the build and another component that's
 

2891
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,470
the build and another component that's
hosting and as we mentioned you know

2892
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:00,480
hosting and as we mentioned you know
 

2893
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,190
hosting and as we mentioned you know
there's a there's a lot of information

2894
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,200
there's a there's a lot of information
 

2895
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,470
there's a there's a lot of information
it's really cool to have a lot of

2896
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:04,480
it's really cool to have a lot of
 

2897
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,150
it's really cool to have a lot of
information about your infrastructure to

2898
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:06,160
information about your infrastructure to
 

2899
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,750
information about your infrastructure to
know exactly what's deployed what's

2900
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:07,760
know exactly what's deployed what's
 

2901
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,990
know exactly what's deployed what's
talking to what uh how it's structured

2902
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:10,000
talking to what uh how it's structured
 

2903
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,750
talking to what uh how it's structured
what versions you're using

2904
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:12,760
what versions you're using
 

2905
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,109
what versions you're using
um and and if you have that narrow waste

2906
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:17,119
um and and if you have that narrow waste
 

2907
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,710
um and and if you have that narrow waste
not only do you have does the user have

2908
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
not only do you have does the user have
 

2909
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,230
not only do you have does the user have
to deal with two different things but

2910
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:20,240
to deal with two different things but
 

2911
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,829
to deal with two different things but
you lose a lot of information in the

2912
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:21,839
you lose a lot of information in the
 

2913
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,270
you lose a lot of information in the
communication process so we focus

2914
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:25,280
communication process so we focus
 

2915
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,109
communication process so we focus
initially on CI and we have like a

2916
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
initially on CI and we have like a
 

2917
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,549
initially on CI and we have like a
decent number of companies now sort of

2918
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
decent number of companies now sort of
 

2919
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,510
decent number of companies now sort of
using this as their main CI um and I

2920
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,520
using this as their main CI um and I
 

2921
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,789
using this as their main CI um and I
would consider that very stable um the

2922
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:34,799
would consider that very stable um the
 

2923
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,870
would consider that very stable um the
the hosting part is also something that

2924
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
the hosting part is also something that
 

2925
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,030
the hosting part is also something that
we have more and more companies adopting

2926
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:40,040
we have more and more companies adopting
 

2927
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:44,549
we have more and more companies adopting
um uh but it still has some rough edges

2928
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:44,559
um uh but it still has some rough edges
 

2929
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,349
um uh but it still has some rough edges
and some many features missing and then

2930
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:47,359
and some many features missing and then
 

2931
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,829
and some many features missing and then
another component that we uh recently

2932
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:49,839
another component that we uh recently
 

2933
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,589
another component that we uh recently
released is what we call GX modules

2934
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:51,599
released is what we call GX modules
 

2935
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,150
released is what we call GX modules
right and the idea here

2936
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:53,160
right and the idea here
 

2937
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,950
right and the idea here
is you know the reason why NX is is part

2938
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:56,960
is you know the reason why NX is is part
 

2939
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,510
is you know the reason why NX is is part
of the reason

2940
00:59:58,510 --> 00:59:58,520
of the reason
 

2941
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,950
of the reason
why part of the reason why Nix adoption

2942
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:00,960
why part of the reason why Nix adoption
 

2943
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,349
why part of the reason why Nix adoption
is is is being less than stellar is

2944
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:03,359
is is is being less than stellar is
 

2945
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,750
is is is being less than stellar is
because of this big big steep learning

2946
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:05,760
because of this big big steep learning
 

2947
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,670
because of this big big steep learning
curve right so what we do is we say okay

2948
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
curve right so what we do is we say okay
 

2949
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,750
curve right so what we do is we say okay
here's here's a way of generating the

2950
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:09,760
here's here's a way of generating the
 

2951
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,190
here's here's a way of generating the
base uh uh nyx configuration for various

2952
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,200
base uh uh nyx configuration for various
 

2953
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,470
base uh uh nyx configuration for various
different types of projects if you tell

2954
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:14,480
different types of projects if you tell
 

2955
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,829
different types of projects if you tell
us hey I have a Rust project um and it

2956
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:17,839
us hey I have a Rust project um and it
 

2957
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,710
us hey I have a Rust project um and it
uses this version of of of cargo and

2958
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
uses this version of of of cargo and
 

2959
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,910
uses this version of of of cargo and
rust and then we can generate something

2960
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:23,920
rust and then we can generate something
 

2961
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,710
rust and then we can generate something
and create a PR in your in your code

2962
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:26,720
and create a PR in your in your code
 

2963
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,230
and create a PR in your in your code
that captures exactly what it is that

2964
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:28,240
that captures exactly what it is that
 

2965
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,270
that captures exactly what it is that
you need to do so that you don't have to

2966
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
you need to do so that you don't have to
 

2967
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,190
you need to do so that you don't have to
learn next at first right so that that

2968
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:31,200
learn next at first right so that that
 

2969
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,470
learn next at first right so that that
initial hump um isn't there yeah yeah

2970
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:34,480
initial hump um isn't there yeah yeah
 

2971
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,549
initial hump um isn't there yeah yeah
there does need to be a kind of here's

2972
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:36,559
there does need to be a kind of here's
 

2973
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,390
there does need to be a kind of here's
uh here's your first recipe

2974
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:38,400
uh here's your first recipe
 

2975
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,230
uh here's your first recipe
automatically written for you exactly

2976
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:40,240
automatically written for you exactly
 

2977
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,390
automatically written for you exactly
yeah yeah so then you can get to you

2978
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,400
yeah yeah so then you can get to you
 

2979
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,630
yeah yeah so then you can get to you
know in three minutes or five minutes

2980
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
know in three minutes or five minutes
 

2981
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,870
know in three minutes or five minutes
you can get

2982
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:45,880
you can get
 

2983
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,990
you can get
to CI and deployments working and you

2984
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,000
to CI and deployments working and you
 

2985
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,910
to CI and deployments working and you
know dev shells and whatnot working uh

2986
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:52,920
know dev shells and whatnot working uh
 

2987
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,430
know dev shells and whatnot working uh
without having learned next right and

2988
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:55,440
without having learned next right and
 

2989
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,630
without having learned next right and
then if you need to change the cargo

2990
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:58,640
then if you need to change the cargo
 

2991
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,390
then if you need to change the cargo
version it's relatively intuitive what

2992
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:00,400
version it's relatively intuitive what
 

2993
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,710
version it's relatively intuitive what
to do and you can learn gradually um on

2994
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:03,720
to do and you can learn gradually um on
 

2995
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,549
to do and you can learn gradually um on
an a per need basis rather than you know

2996
01:01:06,549 --> 01:01:06,559
an a per need basis rather than you know
 

2997
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,510
an a per need basis rather than you know
spending so much time and effort um up

2998
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,520
spending so much time and effort um up
 

2999
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,230
spending so much time and effort um up
front before seeing any serious results

3000
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
front before seeing any serious results
 

3001
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,470
front before seeing any serious results
which is hope I guess you're hoping is

3002
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:14,480
which is hope I guess you're hoping is
 

3003
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,150
which is hope I guess you're hoping is
why you won't need everyone who learns

3004
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,160
why you won't need everyone who learns
 

3005
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,109
why you won't need everyone who learns
Nyx to be a paid contractor for Exactly

3006
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:19,119
Nyx to be a paid contractor for Exactly
 

3007
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,829
Nyx to be a paid contractor for Exactly
yeah yeah yeah it it you can think of it

3008
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:21,839
yeah yeah yeah it it you can think of it
 

3009
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,670
yeah yeah yeah it it you can think of it
you know this last component modules you

3010
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:23,680
you know this last component modules you
 

3011
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,750
you know this last component modules you
can kind of think of it like anible I

3012
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:25,760
can kind of think of it like anible I
 

3013
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,230
can kind of think of it like anible I
think right like anible has this YAML

3014
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240
think right like anible has this YAML
 

3015
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,710
think right like anible has this YAML
syntax where if you have uh the Ansible

3016
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:32,720
syntax where if you have uh the Ansible
 

3017
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,750
syntax where if you have uh the Ansible
uh recipes I forget what they're called

3018
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760
uh recipes I forget what they're called
 

3019
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,750
uh recipes I forget what they're called
u you can expose a way of calling those

3020
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
u you can expose a way of calling those
 

3021
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,549
u you can expose a way of calling those
arguments via YAML so for most users you

3022
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:40,559
arguments via YAML so for most users you
 

3023
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,990
arguments via YAML so for most users you
can just learn learn how to use

3024
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,000
can just learn learn how to use
 

3025
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,230
can just learn learn how to use
uh the YAML component of of anible but

3026
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
uh the YAML component of of anible but
 

3027
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,589
uh the YAML component of of anible but
for users who um are more familiar with

3028
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:51,599
for users who um are more familiar with
 

3029
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,670
for users who um are more familiar with
Ruby and the the Anible internals they

3030
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,680
Ruby and the the Anible internals they
 

3031
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,710
Ruby and the the Anible internals they
can write these recipes right and so so

3032
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:56,720
can write these recipes right and so so
 

3033
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,710
can write these recipes right and so so
uh it's and maybe at some point you sort

3034
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:58,720
uh it's and maybe at some point you sort
 

3035
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,470
uh it's and maybe at some point you sort
of migrate slowly from being one type of

01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
of migrate slowly from being one type of
 

3037
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,549
of migrate slowly from being one type of

3039
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,390

uh maybe amortizing that cost uh over

3040
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:08,400
uh maybe amortizing that cost uh over
 

3041
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,910
uh maybe amortizing that cost uh over
the lifetime of of your interaction your

3042
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:11,920
the lifetime of of your interaction your

usage with of anible or of kinx modules

3044
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:15,520
usage with of anible or of kinx modules
 

3045
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,670
usage with of anible or of kinx modules
yeah do you know I've never quite been I

3046
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:17,680
yeah do you know I've never quite been I
 

3047
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,750
yeah do you know I've never quite been I
I see the logic of that i've never quite

3048
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:19,760
I see the logic of that i've never quite
 

3049
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,670
I see the logic of that i've never quite
been fond of that approach because it

3050
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,680
been fond of that approach because it
 

3051
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,910
been fond of that approach because it
means that as you become more advanced a

3052
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:23,920
means that as you become more advanced a
 

3053
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,990
means that as you become more advanced a
user there's inevitably going to be that

3054
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,000
user there's inevitably going to be that
 

3055
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,270
user there's inevitably going to be that
point where you have to switch languages

3056
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
point where you have to switch languages
 

3057
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,990
point where you have to switch languages
yes yes and presumably you're avoiding

3058
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
yes yes and presumably you're avoiding
 

3059
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,789
yes yes and presumably you're avoiding
that

3060
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:33,799
that
 

3061
01:02:33,799 --> 01:02:36,230
that
u we'll still see right and I think to

3062
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
u we'll still see right and I think to
 

3063
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,510
u we'll still see right and I think to
some extent uh part of

3064
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:40,520
some extent uh part of
 

3065
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,670
some extent uh part of
uh part of what we think is like you

3066
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
uh part of what we think is like you
 

3067
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,390
uh part of what we think is like you
know we have to gather a lot of a lot of

3068
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
know we have to gather a lot of a lot of
 

3069
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,750
know we have to gather a lot of a lot of
experience from various different users

3070
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:47,760
experience from various different users
 

3071
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,549
experience from various different users
to see

3072
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:49,559
to see
 

3073
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:52,390
to see
um it's similar actually with uh build

3074
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:52,400
um it's similar actually with uh build
 

3075
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,710
um it's similar actually with uh build
packs right like Heroku and and I think

3076
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:54,720
packs right like Heroku and and I think
 

3077
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,990
packs right like Heroku and and I think
render as well use these use use the

3078
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
render as well use these use use the
 

3079
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,270
render as well use these use use the
same technique which is like you don't

3080
01:02:59,270 --> 01:02:59,280
same technique which is like you don't
 

3081
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,190
same technique which is like you don't
have to learn exactly what script is

3082
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:01,200
have to learn exactly what script is
 

3083
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,030
have to learn exactly what script is
being run in order to build your project

3084
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:03,040
being run in order to build your project
 

3085
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,630
being run in order to build your project
and deploy your project um you can just

3086
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:06,640
and deploy your project um you can just
 

3087
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,109
and deploy your project um you can just
uh be largely ignorant of that or have a

3088
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
uh be largely ignorant of that or have a
 

3089
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,309
uh be largely ignorant of that or have a
tiny bit of configuration but if it gets

3090
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
tiny bit of configuration but if it gets
 

3091
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,430
tiny bit of configuration but if it gets
more complex you're going to have to dip

3092
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:13,440
more complex you're going to have to dip
 

3093
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,029
more complex you're going to have to dip
into to those build packs right um yes

3094
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:17,039
into to those build packs right um yes
 

3095
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,150
into to those build packs right um yes
but is your configuration still in Nyx

3096
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
but is your configuration still in Nyx
 

3097
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,109
but is your configuration still in Nyx
the language yes it is so there won't

3098
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:23,119
the language yes it is so there won't
 

3099
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,309
the language yes it is so there won't
come a time where I need to switch

3100
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:24,319
come a time where I need to switch
 

3101
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,910
come a time where I need to switch
language to actually use all the

3102
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
language to actually use all the
 

3103
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,710
language to actually use all the
features right that's right yeah yeah

3104
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
features right that's right yeah yeah
 

3105
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,029
features right that's right yeah yeah
and sort of having poking holes you know

3106
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
and sort of having poking holes you know
 

3107
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,109
and sort of having poking holes you know
or sort

3108
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:32,119
or sort
 

3109
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:34,789
or sort
of making that transition be nice is

3110
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
of making that transition be nice is
 

3111
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,710
of making that transition be nice is
something that like involves careful

3112
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:36,720
something that like involves careful
 

3113
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,549
something that like involves careful
design there's no sort of

3114
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:39,559
design there's no sort of
 

3115
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:42,230
design there's no sort of
uh you know let's let's say that you you

3116
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
uh you know let's let's say that you you
 

3117
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,510
uh you know let's let's say that you you
know you have you want to override a

3118
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:43,520
know you have you want to override a
 

3119
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,069
know you have you want to override a
particular version of a dependency um

3120
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:46,079
particular version of a dependency um
 

3121
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,829
particular version of a dependency um
maybe you have a field that does that

3122
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:47,839
maybe you have a field that does that
 

3123
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,230
maybe you have a field that does that
easily uh or maybe this is a time where

3124
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,240
easily uh or maybe this is a time where
 

3125
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,069
easily uh or maybe this is a time where
you have to learn about fetchgate

3126
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
you have to learn about fetchgate
 

3127
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,270
you have to learn about fetchgate
built-in fetch gate or something like

3128
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:53,280
built-in fetch gate or something like
 

3129
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,789
built-in fetch gate or something like
this right like you have to decide very

3130
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:54,799
this right like you have to decide very
 

3131
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,109
this right like you have to decide very
carefully when that happens and how it

3132
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,119
carefully when that happens and how it
 

3133
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,910
carefully when that happens and how it
is that the user experiences that

3134
01:03:59,910 --> 01:03:59,920
is that the user experiences that
 

3135
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,910
is that the user experiences that
transition and how they learn about it

3136
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:01,920
transition and how they learn about it
 

3137
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,390
transition and how they learn about it
and whatnot and I think it's just a lot

3138
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:04,400
and whatnot and I think it's just a lot
 

3139
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,750
and whatnot and I think it's just a lot
like designing a library or a

3140
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
like designing a library or a
 

3141
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,950
like designing a library or a
programming language it's just something

3142
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
programming language it's just something
 

3143
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,750
programming language it's just something
that the nitty-gritty details have to

3144
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:09,760
that the nitty-gritty details have to
 

3145
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,630
that the nitty-gritty details have to
have to be considered and done with love

3146
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:12,640
have to be considered and done with love
 

3147
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,789
have to be considered and done with love
right yeah yeah and it's one of those

3148
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:14,799
right yeah yeah and it's one of those
 

3149
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,750
right yeah yeah and it's one of those
design decisions that will eventually

3150
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760
design decisions that will eventually
 

3151
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,230
design decisions that will eventually
shape and limit the size of your user

3152
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:20,240
shape and limit the size of your user
 

3153
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,789
shape and limit the size of your user
base right right yeah are you are you

3154
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:22,799
base right right yeah are you are you
 

3155
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,549
base right right yeah are you are you
just going to appeal to Nick's experts

3156
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:24,559
just going to appeal to Nick's experts
 

3157
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,069
just going to appeal to Nick's experts
or are you going to try and take it to

3158
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:26,079
or are you going to try and take it to
 

3159
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,230
or are you going to try and take it to
the next level where anyone can use it

3160
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:28,240
the next level where anyone can use it
 

3161
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,549
the next level where anyone can use it
yeah exactly and we hope that the answer

3162
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:30,559
yeah exactly and we hope that the answer
 

3163
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,309
yeah exactly and we hope that the answer
is the latter right i think that's our

3164
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
is the latter right i think that's our
 

3165
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,069
is the latter right i think that's our
ambition yeah absolutely so I want to go

3166
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:36,079
ambition yeah absolutely so I want to go
 

3167
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,390
ambition yeah absolutely so I want to go
back and pick you up on three features

3168
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:38,400
back and pick you up on three features
 

3169
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,829
back and pick you up on three features
you said of using Nyx for um deployment

3170
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:43,839
you said of using Nyx for um deployment
 

3171
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,510
you said of using Nyx for um deployment
because I think this is worth you

3172
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,520
because I think this is worth you
 

3173
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,190
because I think this is worth you
unpacking

3174
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:47,200
unpacking
 

3175
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,710
unpacking
um atomic update like atomic deployments

3176
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
um atomic update like atomic deployments
 

3177
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,510
um atomic update like atomic deployments
yeah yeah why does Nyx enable that cuz

3178
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:53,520
yeah yeah why does Nyx enable that cuz
 

3179
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,589
yeah yeah why does Nyx enable that cuz
that sounds like a useful thing to move

3180
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:55,599
that sounds like a useful thing to move
 

3181
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,029
that sounds like a useful thing to move
everything to the new version all at

3182
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:57,039
everything to the new version all at
 

3183
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,470
everything to the new version all at
once yeah yeah yeah

3184
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:01,480
once yeah yeah yeah
 

3185
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,750
once yeah yeah yeah
uh yeah so so atomic uh deployments are

3186
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:05,760
uh yeah so so atomic uh deployments are
 

3187
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,789
uh yeah so so atomic uh deployments are
something that you can see in two ways

3188
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:06,799
something that you can see in two ways
 

3189
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,549
something that you can see in two ways
right like one one question is the zero

3190
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:08,559
right like one one question is the zero
 

3191
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:09,990
right like one one question is the zero
downtime question right like in this

3192
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
downtime question right like in this
 

3193
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,349
downtime question right like in this
this is something that's familiar to

3194
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:11,359
this is something that's familiar to
 

3195
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:15,670
this is something that's familiar to
everyone uh as soon as you have you know

3196
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:15,680
everyone uh as soon as you have you know
 

3197
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,789
everyone uh as soon as you have you know
something that's a little bit more than

3198
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:16,799
something that's a little bit more than
 

3199
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,510
something that's a little bit more than
your personal

3200
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:18,520
your personal
 

3201
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,270
your personal
website you probably worry about the

3202
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:21,280
website you probably worry about the
 

3203
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,510
website you probably worry about the
amount of downtime that you have if any

3204
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,520
amount of downtime that you have if any
 

3205
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,549
amount of downtime that you have if any
when you upgrade the version of of your

3206
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:26,559
when you upgrade the version of of your
 

3207
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,549
when you upgrade the version of of your
OS or of your dependencies or of your

3208
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
OS or of your dependencies or of your
 

3209
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,670
OS or of your dependencies or of your
application right um do you stop that

3210
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
application right um do you stop that
 

3211
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,309
application right um do you stop that
application and start a new version do

3212
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319
application and start a new version do
 

3213
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,670
application and start a new version do
you have a gradual roll out as with

3214
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:36,680
you have a gradual roll out as with
 

3215
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,910
you have a gradual roll out as with
Kubernetes

3216
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:38,920
Kubernetes
 

3217
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,510
Kubernetes
um and

3218
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,520
um and
 

3219
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,670
um and
um and what we do um I think you know

3220
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:45,680
um and what we do um I think you know
 

3221
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,870
um and what we do um I think you know
the

3222
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:47,880
the
 

3223
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,390
the
the what I think is exciting that we do

3224
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
the what I think is exciting that we do
 

3225
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,430
the what I think is exciting that we do
is we we extend the idea of Nyx to the

3226
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
is we we extend the idea of Nyx to the
 

3227
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,349
is we we extend the idea of Nyx to the
cloud by using these hashbased

3228
01:05:56,349 --> 01:05:56,359
cloud by using these hashbased
 

3229
01:05:56,359 --> 01:06:01,270
cloud by using these hashbased
names we use them as uh domain names for

3230
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:01,280
names we use them as uh domain names for
 

3231
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,510
names we use them as uh domain names for
your web servers

3232
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
your web servers
 

3233
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,710
your web servers
this is a bit of a crazy

3234
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:05,720
this is a bit of a crazy
 

3235
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,950
this is a bit of a crazy
idea but when you deploy a web you know

3236
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:08,960
idea but when you deploy a web you know
 

3237
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,549
idea but when you deploy a web you know
I mentioned that when you build a

3238
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:10,559
I mentioned that when you build a
 

3239
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,270
I mentioned that when you build a
version of your of your package it gets

3240
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:13,280
version of your of your package it gets
 

3241
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,510
version of your of your package it gets
a hash name that uniquely identifies it

3242
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
a hash name that uniquely identifies it
 

3243
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,670
a hash name that uniquely identifies it
right and and if anything has that name

3244
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:17,680
right and and if anything has that name
 

3245
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,950
right and and if anything has that name
it's the same thing now when you have a

3246
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:20,960
it's the same thing now when you have a
 

3247
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,789
it's the same thing now when you have a
recipe for how to build an entire OS um

3248
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
recipe for how to build an entire OS um
 

3249
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,549
recipe for how to build an entire OS um
you can also hash that and all of its

3250
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
you can also hash that and all of its
 

3251
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,549
you can also hash that and all of its
inputs and that it also gives you a name

3252
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:28,559
inputs and that it also gives you a name
 

3253
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,470
inputs and that it also gives you a name
that uniquely identifies that behavior

3254
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:31,480
that uniquely identifies that behavior
 

3255
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,150
that uniquely identifies that behavior
modular you know state which we can talk

3256
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,160
modular you know state which we can talk
 

3257
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,390
modular you know state which we can talk
about later

3258
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:36,400
about later
 

3259
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,910
about later
the volumes that you have attached and

3260
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
the volumes that you have attached and
 

3261
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,390
the volumes that you have attached and
whatnot i think I see where you're going

3262
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:40,400
whatnot i think I see where you're going
 

3263
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,870
whatnot i think I see where you're going
with this so you would be able to build

3264
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:42,880
with this so you would be able to build
 

3265
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,190
with this so you would be able to build
the new version entirely get it up and

3266
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,200
the new version entirely get it up and
 

3267
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,990
the new version entirely get it up and
running under a new domain name hash and

3268
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
running under a new domain name hash and
 

3269
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,069
running under a new domain name hash and
then your atomic update is switch the

3270
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:50,079
then your atomic update is switch the
 

3271
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,270
then your atomic update is switch the
load balancer exactly exactly yeah yeah

3272
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,280
load balancer exactly exactly yeah yeah
 

3273
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,950
load balancer exactly exactly yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay so you switch the load

3274
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:54,960
yeah yeah okay so you switch the load
 

3275
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,309
yeah yeah okay so you switch the load
balancer and that gives you the atomic

3276
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
balancer and that gives you the atomic
 

3277
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:59,270
balancer and that gives you the atomic
part right yeah so then we have to talk

3278
01:06:59,270 --> 01:06:59,280
part right yeah so then we have to talk
 

3279
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,029
part right yeah so then we have to talk
about state because that I can see that

3280
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:01,039
about state because that I can see that
 

3281
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,750
about state because that I can see that
working perfectly until my database

3282
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:03,760
working perfectly until my database
 

3283
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,270
working perfectly until my database
files also need to move over yeah yeah

3284
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,280
files also need to move over yeah yeah
 

3285
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,510
files also need to move over yeah yeah
yeah so let let's let's maybe just

3286
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:09,520
yeah so let let's let's maybe just
 

3287
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,710
yeah so let let's let's maybe just
elucidate a little bit more of the

3288
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:10,720
elucidate a little bit more of the
 

3289
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,710
elucidate a little bit more of the
picture so it's clearer what the

3290
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
picture so it's clearer what the
 

3291
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,630
picture so it's clearer what the
advantages are and how it works right so

3292
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:14,640
advantages are and how it works right so
 

3293
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,510
advantages are and how it works right so
we have these uh hashes and as you

3294
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:17,520
we have these uh hashes and as you
 

3295
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,270
we have these uh hashes and as you
mentioned we switch atomically the load

3296
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:19,280
mentioned we switch atomically the load
 

3297
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,670
mentioned we switch atomically the load
balancer but the way in which each

3298
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:21,680
balancer but the way in which each
 

3299
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,829
balancer but the way in which each
server is talking to one another is

3300
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
server is talking to one another is
 

3301
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,349
server is talking to one another is
using those hashes as well right um so

3302
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
using those hashes as well right um so
 

3303
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,430
using those hashes as well right um so
the really nice thing is when you have a

3304
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:29,440
the really nice thing is when you have a
 

3305
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,390
the really nice thing is when you have a
when you have an upgrade um and you only

3306
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
when you have an upgrade um and you only
 

3307
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,150
when you have an upgrade um and you only
change one server that's that's

3308
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:35,160
change one server that's that's
 

3309
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,630
change one server that's that's
uh that uh isn't talking to any other

3310
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:38,640
uh that uh isn't talking to any other
 

3311
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,430
uh that uh isn't talking to any other
servers but is receiving requests from

3312
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:40,440
servers but is receiving requests from
 

3313
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,190
servers but is receiving requests from
them

3314
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:42,200
them
 

3315
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,910
them
um then what happens is you know now in

3316
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:45,920
um then what happens is you know now in
 

3317
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,190
um then what happens is you know now in
theory all these servers that are

3318
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,200
theory all these servers that are
 

3319
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,589
theory all these servers that are
talking to it also uh also change

3320
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:49,599
talking to it also uh also change
 

3321
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,789
talking to it also uh also change
because they're talking to a new version

3322
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:50,799
because they're talking to a new version
 

3323
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,150
because they're talking to a new version
right and so their behavior is different

3324
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:52,160
right and so their behavior is different
 

3325
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,510
right and so their behavior is different
right like in the same way that if I

3326
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:53,520
right like in the same way that if I
 

3327
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,109
right like in the same way that if I
have a function fu and it calls a

3328
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:55,119
have a function fu and it calls a
 

3329
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:56,789
have a function fu and it calls a
function bar and bar changes then in

3330
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:56,799
function bar and bar changes then in
 

3331
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,230
function bar and bar changes then in
some sense the behavior of fu also

3332
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,240
some sense the behavior of fu also
 

3333
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,069
some sense the behavior of fu also
changed

3334
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
changed
 

3335
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,910
changed
so all of those get new hashes as well

3336
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
so all of those get new hashes as well
 

3337
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,230
so all of those get new hashes as well
and they all get deployed but if it's

3338
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:04,240
and they all get deployed but if it's
 

3339
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,589
and they all get deployed but if it's
the other way around where you have a

3340
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
the other way around where you have a
 

3341
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,230
the other way around where you have a
server that isn't being queried but it's

3342
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,240
server that isn't being queried but it's
 

3343
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,829
server that isn't being queried but it's
talking to various different servers you

3344
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:09,839
talking to various different servers you
 

3345
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,150
talking to various different servers you
just have to deploy that new version and

3346
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:12,160
just have to deploy that new version and
 

3347
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,349
just have to deploy that new version and
it can talk to all the old

3348
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:13,359
it can talk to all the old
 

3349
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:14,950
it can talk to all the old
infrastructure

3350
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:14,960
infrastructure
 

3351
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,189
infrastructure
yes so you when I deploy my new version

3352
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:17,199
yes so you when I deploy my new version
 

3353
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,749
yes so you when I deploy my new version
you can say for definite you haven't

3354
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:19,759
you can say for definite you haven't
 

3355
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,829
you can say for definite you haven't
changed the version of Postgress that

3356
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:21,839
changed the version of Postgress that
 

3357
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,070
changed the version of Postgress that
doesn't get a new hash so we just yeah

3358
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,080
doesn't get a new hash so we just yeah
 

3359
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,590
doesn't get a new hash so we just yeah
the web servers just keep talking to the

3360
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:25,600
the web servers just keep talking to the
 

3361
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,309
the web servers just keep talking to the
same old database exactly exactly so

3362
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:28,319
same old database exactly exactly so
 

3363
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,470
same old database exactly exactly so
this is a minimal upgrade right you you

3364
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:30,480
this is a minimal upgrade right you you
 

3365
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,630
this is a minimal upgrade right you you
you spin up only the things that really

3366
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,640
you spin up only the things that really
 

3367
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,669
you spin up only the things that really
changed but it's also atomic both in the

3368
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:35,679
changed but it's also atomic both in the
 

3369
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,149
changed but it's also atomic both in the
sense of zero downtime but just as

3370
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:38,159
sense of zero downtime but just as
 

3371
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,070
sense of zero downtime but just as
importantly and even more excitingly I

3372
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,080
importantly and even more excitingly I
 

3373
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,269
importantly and even more excitingly I
think uh the version upgrades happen

3374
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:43,279
think uh the version upgrades happen
 

3375
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:44,470
think uh the version upgrades happen
atomically you're never going to be

3376
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:44,480
atomically you're never going to be
 

3377
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,709
atomically you're never going to be
talking your new version of um of your

3378
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:48,719
talking your new version of um of your
 

3379
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:49,910
talking your new version of um of your
application is never going to be talking

3380
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:49,920
application is never going to be talking
 

3381
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,630
application is never going to be talking
to an old version of of your new version

3382
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
to an old version of of your new version
 

3383
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,669
to an old version of of your new version
of the front end is never going to be

3384
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:53,679
of the front end is never going to be
 

3385
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:54,870
of the front end is never going to be
talking to an old version of the back

3386
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
talking to an old version of the back
 

3387
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,229
talking to an old version of the back
end right

3388
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:56,239
end right
 

3389
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:59,189
end right
um or of server one versus server two

3390
01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
um or of server one versus server two
 

3391
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,030
um or of server one versus server two
and so you never have to worry one one

3392
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,040
and so you never have to worry one one
 

3393
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,070
and so you never have to worry one one
thing that occupies you know occupies

3394
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,080
thing that occupies you know occupies
 

3395
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,669
thing that occupies you know occupies
developers a lot and is really annoying

3396
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:05,679
developers a lot and is really annoying
 

3397
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,110
developers a lot and is really annoying
to think about it's like oh like always

3398
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,120
to think about it's like oh like always
 

3399
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,789
to think about it's like oh like always
maintain backwards compatibility in all

3400
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:08,799
maintain backwards compatibility in all
 

3401
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,470
maintain backwards compatibility in all
of your APIs because nothing is ever

3402
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
of your APIs because nothing is ever
 

3403
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,829
of your APIs because nothing is ever
atomic right like you're always going to

3404
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:11,839
atomic right like you're always going to
 

3405
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,669
atomic right like you're always going to
have different version mismatches as you

3406
01:09:13,669 --> 01:09:13,679
have different version mismatches as you
 

3407
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,590
have different version mismatches as you
upgrade and roll out things whereas here

3408
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
upgrade and roll out things whereas here
 

3409
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,110
upgrade and roll out things whereas here
they're not they're atomic everything's

3410
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:17,120
they're not they're atomic everything's
 

3411
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,070
they're not they're atomic everything's
atomic so you really can look at your

3412
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:20,080
atomic so you really can look at your
 

3413
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,709
atomic so you really can look at your
code as a point in time thing right you

3414
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
code as a point in time thing right you
 

3415
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,470
code as a point in time thing right you
don't have to worry about what what it

3416
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:24,480
don't have to worry about what what it
 

3417
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,390
don't have to worry about what what it
looked like yesterday before you made

3418
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
looked like yesterday before you made
 

3419
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,870
looked like yesterday before you made
this change um you can develop in a very

3420
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:30,880
this change um you can develop in a very
 

3421
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,709
this change um you can develop in a very
uh clean way so that's another big

3422
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:34,719
uh clean way so that's another big
 

3423
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,349
uh clean way so that's another big
advantage of this

3424
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:36,359
advantage of this
 

3425
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,349
advantage of this
hashbasedly this also makes it easy if I

3426
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
hashbasedly this also makes it easy if I
 

3427
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,269
hashbasedly this also makes it easy if I
do want to maintain two different

3428
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:41,279
do want to maintain two different
 

3429
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,349
do want to maintain two different
versions like if I promise to keep the

3430
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:43,359
versions like if I promise to keep the
 

3431
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,430
versions like if I promise to keep the
old JSON API running for that client

3432
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:47,440
old JSON API running for that client
 

3433
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,990
old JSON API running for that client
yeah yeah the one technique that we

3434
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,000
yeah yeah the one technique that we
 

3435
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,910
yeah yeah the one technique that we
haven't implemented yet but uh we're

3436
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:51,920
haven't implemented yet but uh we're
 

3437
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,630
haven't implemented yet but uh we're
excited about is you know

3438
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:55,640
excited about is you know
 

3439
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,149
excited about is you know
uh

3440
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:57,159
uh
 

3441
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,149
uh
uh leaving versions on for external

3442
01:10:00,149 --> 01:10:00,159
uh leaving versions on for external
 

3443
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,750
uh leaving versions on for external
users so that they also don't have to

3444
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:01,760
users so that they also don't have to
 

3445
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,189
users so that they also don't have to
worry about this right like if they use

3446
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
worry about this right like if they use
 

3447
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,790
worry about this right like if they use
a if they use this hash domains um you

3448
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,800
a if they use this hash domains um you
 

3449
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,630
a if they use this hash domains um you
can just keep track of you can keep

3450
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
can just keep track of you can keep
 

3451
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,870
can just keep track of you can keep
upgrading without backward compatibility

3452
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:10,880
upgrading without backward compatibility
 

3453
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,709
upgrading without backward compatibility
changes u concerns um and then just keep

3454
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
changes u concerns um and then just keep
 

3455
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,790
changes u concerns um and then just keep
track um in the load balancer level of

3456
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:16,800
track um in the load balancer level of
 

3457
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,270
track um in the load balancer level of
how many requests are coming in from

3458
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:19,280
how many requests are coming in from
 

3459
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,350
how many requests are coming in from
from the external world for for those

3460
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:21,360
from the external world for for those
 

3461
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,510
from the external world for for those
old versions and and you know maybe you

3462
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:25,520
old versions and and you know maybe you
 

3463
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,709
old versions and and you know maybe you
have a threshold that says you know like

3464
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:26,719
have a threshold that says you know like
 

3465
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,870
have a threshold that says you know like
if there's fewer than one request a

3466
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:28,880
if there's fewer than one request a
 

3467
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,229
if there's fewer than one request a
month then you can then it's safe to

3468
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:30,239
month then you can then it's safe to
 

3469
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:32,790
month then you can then it's safe to
spin this down yeah unless that request

3470
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:32,800
spin this down yeah unless that request
 

3471
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,470
spin this down yeah unless that request
is coming from our biggest client in

3472
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:34,480
is coming from our biggest client in
 

3473
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,070
is coming from our biggest client in
which case we got to negotiate with them

3474
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
which case we got to negotiate with them
 

3475
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,950
which case we got to negotiate with them
bet that happens I bet you

3476
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:40,960
bet that happens I bet you
 

3477
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,830
bet that happens I bet you
right right uh or alternatively you know

3478
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:43,840
right right uh or alternatively you know
 

3479
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,510
right right uh or alternatively you know
like there are even weirder ways of

3480
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:45,520
like there are even weirder ways of
 

3481
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,950
like there are even weirder ways of
thinking right which is like a uh kind

3482
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:48,960
thinking right which is like a uh kind
 

3483
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,630
thinking right which is like a uh kind
of you can develop as

3484
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:51,640
of you can develop as
 

3485
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,470
of you can develop as
a AB testing sort of right like you can

3486
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,480
a AB testing sort of right like you can
 

3487
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,510
a AB testing sort of right like you can
do deployments and then just see uh see

3488
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:57,520
do deployments and then just see uh see
 

3489
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,350
do deployments and then just see uh see
what versions people like the mo the

3490
01:10:59,350 --> 01:10:59,360
what versions people like the mo the
 

3491
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,709
what versions people like the mo the
most right like Yeah yeah uh maybe you

3492
01:11:02,709 --> 01:11:02,719
most right like Yeah yeah uh maybe you
 

3493
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,229
most right like Yeah yeah uh maybe you
you know maybe you have a branch where

3494
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:04,239
you know maybe you have a branch where
 

3495
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:05,350
you know maybe you have a branch where
you're doing some work and you just

3496
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:05,360
you're doing some work and you just
 

3497
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,390
you're doing some work and you just
deploy that um and it lives as a fork or

3498
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:08,400
deploy that um and it lives as a fork or
 

3499
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,590
deploy that um and it lives as a fork or
as a separate branch for a long time um

3500
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:11,600
as a separate branch for a long time um
 

3501
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,270
as a separate branch for a long time um
we are getting into the world where this

3502
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:13,280
we are getting into the world where this
 

3503
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,110
we are getting into the world where this
one language which describes my

3504
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
one language which describes my
 

3505
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,669
one language which describes my
dependencies and my my language

3506
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:17,679

3507
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,350

dependencies and my out of language

3508
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:19,360

3511
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,709

infrastructure also describes my AB

3512
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:24,719
infrastructure also describes my AB
 

3513
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,229
infrastructure also describes my AB
testing

3514
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
testing
 

3515
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:30,149
testing
and my feature flags yeah yeah exactly

3516
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
and my feature flags yeah yeah exactly
 

3517
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,149
and my feature flags yeah yeah exactly
yeah that's exactly right and not having

3518
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:32,159
yeah that's exactly right and not having
 

3519
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,669
yeah that's exactly right and not having
separate languages and separate

3520
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:33,679
separate languages and separate
 

3521
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:35,910
separate languages and separate
configuration files for all those things

3522
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:35,920
configuration files for all those things
 

3523
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,189
configuration files for all those things
sounds like where we should be yeah yeah

3524
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199
sounds like where we should be yeah yeah
 

3525
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:42,310
sounds like where we should be yeah yeah
i agree um

3526
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:42,320
i agree um
 

3527
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,950
i agree um
so this suggests that most of your

3528
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:44,960
so this suggests that most of your
 

3529
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,229
so this suggests that most of your
future is going to be figuring out

3530
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
future is going to be figuring out
 

3531
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,990
future is going to be figuring out
comfortable ways to describe this and

3532
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,000
comfortable ways to describe this and
 

3533
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,750
comfortable ways to describe this and
then building out all those tools that

3534
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:51,760
then building out all those tools that
 

3535
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,310
then building out all those tools that
introspect on these descriptions and

3536
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,320
introspect on these descriptions and
 

3537
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,470
introspect on these descriptions and
surface things like here's a here's a

3538
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
surface things like here's a here's a
 

3539
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,189
surface things like here's a here's a
CVE you've got to worry about yeah yeah

3540
01:11:59,189 --> 01:11:59,199
CVE you've got to worry about yeah yeah
 

3541
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,750
CVE you've got to worry about yeah yeah
absolutely yeah you must be hiring UI

3542
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:01,760
absolutely yeah you must be hiring UI
 

3543
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,510
absolutely yeah you must be hiring UI
people

3544
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:03,520
people
 

3545
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,950
people
well you will be if you're not

3546
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:05,960
well you will be if you're not
 

3547
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,470
well you will be if you're not
currently uh yeah so far we've you know

3548
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:09,480
currently uh yeah so far we've you know
 

3549
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,750
currently uh yeah so far we've you know
because the majority of our customers

3550
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
because the majority of our customers
 

3551
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,110
because the majority of our customers
until two weeks ago all of our customers

3552
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:15,120
until two weeks ago all of our customers
 

3553
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,630
until two weeks ago all of our customers
were Nexus users i think they're already

3554
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:18,640
were Nexus users i think they're already
 

3555
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,310
were Nexus users i think they're already
kind of familiar with the way these ways

3556
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:20,320
kind of familiar with the way these ways
 

3557
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,229
kind of familiar with the way these ways
of thinking and so it's been relatively

3558
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
of thinking and so it's been relatively
 

3559
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,390
of thinking and so it's been relatively
easy but now as we sort of start start

3560
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:24,400
easy but now as we sort of start start
 

3561
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,669
easy but now as we sort of start start
to expand this it really um it really

3562
01:12:27,669 --> 01:12:27,679
to expand this it really um it really
 

3563
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,149
to expand this it really um it really
does involve thinking very hard about

3564
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:30,159
does involve thinking very hard about
 

3565
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:33,510
does involve thinking very hard about
about how to how to present this in a

3566
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,520
about how to how to present this in a
 

3567
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,110
about how to how to present this in a
way that makes sense right that feels

3568
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:35,120
way that makes sense right that feels
 

3569
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,630
way that makes sense right that feels
intuitive

3570
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:36,640
intuitive
 

3571
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,950
intuitive
yeah yeah okay i'm probably not a great

3572
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960
yeah yeah okay i'm probably not a great
 

3573
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,669
yeah yeah okay i'm probably not a great
barometer of this cuz I'm an existing

3574
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:41,679
barometer of this cuz I'm an existing
 

3575
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,350
barometer of this cuz I'm an existing
Nyx user who was who was forced/paid

3576
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
Nyx user who was who was forced/paid
 

3577
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,590
Nyx user who was who was forced/paid
into it but actually became a convert

3578
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:47,600
into it but actually became a convert
 

3579
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,110
into it but actually became a convert
but there are probably people listening

3580
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,120
but there are probably people listening
 

3581
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,390
but there are probably people listening
to this who are tempted to try Nyx and

3582
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:52,400
to this who are tempted to try Nyx and
 

3583
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,390
to this who are tempted to try Nyx and
perhaps they can become a small flood of

3584
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:54,400
perhaps they can become a small flood of
 

3585
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,270
perhaps they can become a small flood of
uh of test bed users for you so the

3586
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,280
uh of test bed users for you so the
 

3587
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,149
uh of test bed users for you so the
question is how do you get started where

3588
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:00,159
question is how do you get started where
 

3589
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,070
question is how do you get started where
would you recommend someone who's not

3590
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080
would you recommend someone who's not
 

3591
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,310
would you recommend someone who's not
being paid for it to get started with

3592
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:04,320
being paid for it to get started with
 

3593
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,910
being paid for it to get started with
Nyx yeah so this is a bit self- serving

3594
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:07,920
Nyx yeah so this is a bit self- serving
 

3595
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,990
Nyx yeah so this is a bit self- serving
but I think you know our new modules

3596
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
but I think you know our new modules
 

3597
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,110
but I think you know our new modules
project garnix.io/modules

3598
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,120
project garnix.io/modules
 

3599
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,270
project garnix.io/modules
u can uh can help you know with rust or

3600
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,280
u can uh can help you know with rust or
 

3601
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,470
u can uh can help you know with rust or
hasll or u npm projects for instance can

3602
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:20,480
hasll or u npm projects for instance can
 

3603
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,189
hasll or u npm projects for instance can
can get you

3604
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:22,199
can get you
 

3605
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:25,669
can get you
um a lot of the way or the entire way

3606
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:25,679
um a lot of the way or the entire way
 

3607
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,590
um a lot of the way or the entire way
into having hopefully the entire way

3608
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:27,600
into having hopefully the entire way
 

3609
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,750
into having hopefully the entire way
into having a project that compiles and

3610
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:29,760
into having a project that compiles and
 

3611
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,750
into having a project that compiles and
builds with Nyx and CI um and obviously

3612
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:33,760
builds with Nyx and CI um and obviously
 

3613
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,590
builds with Nyx and CI um and obviously
the way I would like for this to work is

3614
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
the way I would like for this to work is
 

3615
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,350
the way I would like for this to work is
that this becomes independent of garnix

3616
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:37,360
that this becomes independent of garnix
 

3617
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,030
that this becomes independent of garnix
altogether um you know in some sense

3618
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:40,040
altogether um you know in some sense
 

3619
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:43,189
altogether um you know in some sense
you I think uh vendor lock in is a

3620
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:43,199
you I think uh vendor lock in is a
 

3621
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,950
you I think uh vendor lock in is a
terrible thing and so to some extent I I

3622
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:44,960
terrible thing and so to some extent I I
 

3623
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,510
terrible thing and so to some extent I I
I hope that you know people consider

3624
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:47,520
I hope that you know people consider
 

3625
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,550
I hope that you know people consider
this even if they don't want to use

3626
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:48,560
this even if they don't want to use
 

3627
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,270
this even if they don't want to use
carex for anything else for CI or uh

3628
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
carex for anything else for CI or uh
 

3629
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,669
carex for anything else for CI or uh
that they generate this file and then go

3630
01:13:53,669 --> 01:13:53,679
that they generate this file and then go
 

3631
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,709
that they generate this file and then go
off and and you know build their project

3632
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719
off and and you know build their project
 

3633
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,590
off and and you know build their project
in in themselves in different CI system

3634
01:13:59,590 --> 01:13:59,600
in in themselves in different CI system
 

3635
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,550
in in themselves in different CI system
and deploy it however they want um but I

3636
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:02,560
and deploy it however they want um but I
 

3637
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,669
and deploy it however they want um but I
think that that's a very good way of

3638
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
think that that's a very good way of
 

3639
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,990
think that that's a very good way of
sort of you know seeing that initial

3640
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:06,000
sort of you know seeing that initial
 

3641
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,149
sort of you know seeing that initial
experience right like seeing Okay this

3642
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:08,159
experience right like seeing Okay this
 

3643
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,990
experience right like seeing Okay this
really works and I can sort of

3644
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,000
really works and I can sort of
 

3645
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,550
really works and I can sort of
understand the package uh infrastructure

3646
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
understand the package uh infrastructure
 

3647
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,149
understand the package uh infrastructure
and I can look at the syntax and then

3648
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:14,159
and I can look at the syntax and then
 

3649
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:15,229
and I can look at the syntax and then
see how it

3650
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:15,239
see how it
 

3651
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:17,669
see how it
reflects facts about my project that I

3652
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:17,679
reflects facts about my project that I
 

3653
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:20,550
reflects facts about my project that I
specified um and understand a little bit

3654
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:20,560
specified um and understand a little bit
 

3655
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,310
specified um and understand a little bit
about about Nyx and get a lot of the

3656
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:22,320
about about Nyx and get a lot of the
 

3657
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,750
about about Nyx and get a lot of the
benefits right like already get a dev

3658
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:23,760
benefits right like already get a dev
 

3659
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,750
benefits right like already get a dev
shell that works for my project um yeah

3660
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:27,760
shell that works for my project um yeah
 

3661
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,950
shell that works for my project um yeah
which languages do you support because

3662
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
which languages do you support because
 

3663
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,229
which languages do you support because
I've tried this with one of my Rust

3664
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:30,239
I've tried this with one of my Rust
 

3665
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,669
I've tried this with one of my Rust
projects and I thought okay if I'm a

3666
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:31,679
projects and I thought okay if I'm a
 

3667
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:34,470
projects and I thought okay if I'm a
Rust user this is pretty straightforward

3668
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
Rust user this is pretty straightforward
 

3669
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,550
Rust user this is pretty straightforward
yeah yeah yeah but presum you have to

3670
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,560
yeah yeah yeah but presum you have to
 

3671
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,310
yeah yeah yeah but presum you have to
write recipes for lots of different

3672
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,320
write recipes for lots of different
 

3673
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,790
write recipes for lots of different
languages to make this universal

3674
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800
languages to make this universal
 

3675
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,350
languages to make this universal
yeah um it it's uh right now it's it's

3676
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:45,360
yeah um it it's uh right now it's it's
 

3677
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,229
yeah um it it's uh right now it's it's
only Node.js projects Haskell projects

3678
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
only Node.js projects Haskell projects
 

3679
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,110
only Node.js projects Haskell projects
uh Rust projects and then also uh you

3680
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:51,120
uh Rust projects and then also uh you
 

3681
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,270
uh Rust projects and then also uh you
know Postgress databases and Linux users

3682
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:53,280
know Postgress databases and Linux users
 

3683
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,950
know Postgress databases and Linux users
as configuration for your

3684
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:55,960
as configuration for your
 

3685
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,630
as configuration for your
uh for your web service if you choose to

3686
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:58,640
uh for your web service if you choose to
 

3687
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,910
uh for your web service if you choose to
deploy web servers as well

3688
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:00,920
deploy web servers as well
 

3689
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:05,590
deploy web servers as well
um but we want to um we want to expand

3690
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:05,600
um but we want to um we want to expand
 

3691
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,270
um but we want to um we want to expand
that a lot and I think you know if there

3692
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,280
that a lot and I think you know if there
 

3693
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,310
that a lot and I think you know if there
are people out there who are really

3694
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,320
are people out there who are really
 

3695
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,750
are people out there who are really
excited about trying this out and want

3696
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
excited about trying this out and want
 

3697
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,510
excited about trying this out and want
to reach out and say like this is the

3698
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:11,520
to reach out and say like this is the
 

3699
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,669
to reach out and say like this is the
project that I want i think for us it's

3700
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:13,679
project that I want i think for us it's
 

3701
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,229
project that I want i think for us it's
very uh very helpful to have that sort

3702
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
very uh very helpful to have that sort
 

3703
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:17,750
very uh very helpful to have that sort
of tight feedback loop so that we can

3704
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
of tight feedback loop so that we can
 

3705
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,630
of tight feedback loop so that we can
see okay like what what is working what

3706
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:20,640
see okay like what what is working what
 

3707
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,950
see okay like what what is working what
isn't working for you so do feel free to

3708
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:22,960
isn't working for you so do feel free to
 

3709
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,350
isn't working for you so do feel free to
reach out if if these aren't uh if what

3710
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:27,360
reach out if if these aren't uh if what
 

3711
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,189
reach out if if these aren't uh if what
you're looking for isn't supported yet

3712
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
you're looking for isn't supported yet
 

3713
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,750
you're looking for isn't supported yet
but so far it's it's those three text

3714
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:33,760
but so far it's it's those three text
 

3715
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,310
but so far it's it's those three text
acts right okay i'm I'm quite surprised

3716
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:36,320
acts right okay i'm I'm quite surprised
 

3717
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,470
acts right okay i'm I'm quite surprised
to hear Python isn't one of your early

3718
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,480
to hear Python isn't one of your early
 

3719
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,910
to hear Python isn't one of your early
adopting languages yeah I think uh I

3720
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:41,920
adopting languages yeah I think uh I
 

3721
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,590
adopting languages yeah I think uh I
think Python would is the natural next

3722
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
think Python would is the natural next
 

3723
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,990
think Python would is the natural next
one um and and yeah that raises a

3724
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,000
one um and and yeah that raises a
 

3725
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,350
one um and and yeah that raises a
question I haven't asked but I'm just

3726
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360
question I haven't asked but I'm just
 

3727
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,669
question I haven't asked but I'm just
going to dip into it quickly what

3728
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:51,679
going to dip into it quickly what
 

3729
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,030
going to dip into it quickly what
language are you building this in

3730
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,040
language are you building this in
 

3731
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,630
language are you building this in
presumably it's one of those three

3732
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:54,640
presumably it's one of those three
 

3733
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,910
presumably it's one of those three
you've already mentioned you're ether

3734
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:55,920
you've already mentioned you're ether
 

3735
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,709
you've already mentioned you're ether
doing this in Node Haskell or Rust tell

3736
01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
doing this in Node Haskell or Rust tell
 

3737
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,470
doing this in Node Haskell or Rust tell
me i reckon I can make a guess but tell

3738
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:00,480
me i reckon I can make a guess but tell
 

3739
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,310
me i reckon I can make a guess but tell
me

3740
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,320
me
 

3741
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,630
me
um actually you know the the full answer

3742
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:04,640
um actually you know the the full answer
 

3743
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,870
um actually you know the the full answer
is all three um our front end is you

3744
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
is all three um our front end is you
 

3745
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,709
is all three um our front end is you
know a nojs project and we have some DNS

3746
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:10,719
know a nojs project and we have some DNS
 

3747
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,630
know a nojs project and we have some DNS
servers and load balancers and whatnot

3748
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:12,640
servers and load balancers and whatnot
 

3749
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,149
servers and load balancers and whatnot
that are in Rust some small projects

3750
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:14,159
that are in Rust some small projects
 

3751
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,630
that are in Rust some small projects
that are in Rust but um but the majority

3752
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:16,640
that are in Rust but um but the majority
 

3753
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,430
that are in Rust but um but the majority
of the codebase is in Haskell um right

3754
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:19,440
of the codebase is in Haskell um right
 

3755
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,110
of the codebase is in Haskell um right
so what you actually need is a

3756
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:21,120
so what you actually need is a
 

3757
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,750
so what you actually need is a
dependency that's built in Python for

3758
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:23,760
dependency that's built in Python for
 

3759
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,350
dependency that's built in Python for
that script to get to production quality

3760
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
that script to get to production quality
 

3761
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,790
that script to get to production quality
yeah exactly and this is Why I say that

3762
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800
yeah exactly and this is Why I say that
 

3763
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,630
yeah exactly and this is Why I say that
you know having having contact with

3764
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:30,640
you know having having contact with
 

3765
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,189
you know having having contact with
someone who is so useful at this stage

3766
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
someone who is so useful at this stage
 

3767
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,630
someone who is so useful at this stage
because so far it's been very easy

3768
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:34,640
because so far it's been very easy
 

3769
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,229
because so far it's been very easy
because we say okay like we let's try

3770
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:36,239
because we say okay like we let's try
 

3771
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,229
because we say okay like we let's try
this out for we're familiar with these

3772
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:38,239
this out for we're familiar with these
 

3773
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:39,910
this out for we're familiar with these
stacks let's try it out for our own

3774
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:39,920
stacks let's try it out for our own
 

3775
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,229
stacks let's try it out for our own
projects let's try it out for uh a

3776
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:42,239
projects let's try it out for uh a
 

3777
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:43,830
projects let's try it out for uh a
couple of French projects and whatnot

3778
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:43,840
couple of French projects and whatnot
 

3779
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,390
couple of French projects and whatnot
but as we move towards you know Ruby for

3780
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
but as we move towards you know Ruby for
 

3781
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,830
but as we move towards you know Ruby for
instance the language that I don't have

3782
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:47,840
instance the language that I don't have
 

3783
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,270
instance the language that I don't have
very much familiarity with um I think

3784
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,280
very much familiarity with um I think
 

3785
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,830
very much familiarity with um I think
it's good to to to to be talking to

3786
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:53,840
it's good to to to to be talking to
 

3787
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,229
it's good to to to to be talking to
people who do

3788
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:56,239
people who do
 

3789
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,510
people who do
Yeah yeah it's also I I'm not sure

3790
01:16:59,510 --> 01:16:59,520
Yeah yeah it's also I I'm not sure
 

3791
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,030
Yeah yeah it's also I I'm not sure
you'll ever get there but Nyx is one of

3792
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
you'll ever get there but Nyx is one of
 

3793
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,149
you'll ever get there but Nyx is one of
the few languages that um at least makes

3794
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,159
the few languages that um at least makes
 

3795
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,870
the few languages that um at least makes
makes the environment of Pearl feel sane

3796
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:06,880
makes the environment of Pearl feel sane
 

3797
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,229
makes the environment of Pearl feel sane
cuz someone's had to go through all the

3798
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
cuz someone's had to go through all the
 

3799
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,310
cuz someone's had to go through all the
pain of writing Nick's recipes to build

3800
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:10,320
pain of writing Nick's recipes to build
 

3801
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,709
pain of writing Nick's recipes to build
Pearl reliably

3802
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:12,719
Pearl reliably
 

3803
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,550
Pearl reliably
that makes Pearl less of a pain you see

3804
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:14,560
that makes Pearl less of a pain you see
 

3805
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,430
that makes Pearl less of a pain you see
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's

3806
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:17,440
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's
 

3807
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,189
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's
deploying Pearl anytime soon but you

3808
01:17:19,189 --> 01:17:19,199
deploying Pearl anytime soon but you
 

3809
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,149
deploying Pearl anytime soon but you
could but I also think you know Zigg for

3810
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:22,159
could but I also think you know Zigg for
 

3811
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,149
could but I also think you know Zigg for
instance or Gleam or things like you

3812
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:24,159
instance or Gleam or things like you
 

3813
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,070
instance or Gleam or things like you
know these new languages that could also

3814
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:26,080
know these new languages that could also
 

3815
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,709
know these new languages that could also
be exciting right like none of that yeah

3816
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:28,719
be exciting right like none of that yeah
 

3817
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,310
be exciting right like none of that yeah
and those are ones that maybe haven't

3818
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:30,320
and those are ones that maybe haven't
 

3819
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,030
and those are ones that maybe haven't
got a fully realized infrastructure

3820
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
got a fully realized infrastructure
 

3821
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,950
got a fully realized infrastructure
story yet yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah

3822
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:36,960
story yet yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah
 

3823
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,310
story yet yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah
it's difficult to know whether you

3824
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:38,320
it's difficult to know whether you
 

3825
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,110
it's difficult to know whether you
should go after the biggest players or

3826
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,120
should go after the biggest players or
 

3827
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,950
should go after the biggest players or
the most hungry for new services players

3828
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:44,960
the most hungry for new services players
 

3829
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,229
the most hungry for new services players
right right um Yeah yeah and it's also

3830
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239
right right um Yeah yeah and it's also
 

3831
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:51,070
right right um Yeah yeah and it's also
you know to some extent

3832
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:51,080
you know to some extent
 

3833
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,189
you know to some extent
uh not only are these technologies newer

3834
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
uh not only are these technologies newer
 

3835
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,270
uh not only are these technologies newer
uh and therefore maybe have less support

3836
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:57,280
uh and therefore maybe have less support
 

3837
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,910
uh and therefore maybe have less support
but also the projects in these languages

3838
01:17:59,910 --> 01:17:59,920
but also the projects in these languages
 

3839
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,630
but also the projects in these languages
are themselves newer so it's more likely

3840
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640
are themselves newer so it's more likely
 

3841
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,550
are themselves newer so it's more likely
that you haven't yet solved or that a

3842
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
that you haven't yet solved or that a
 

3843
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,070
that you haven't yet solved or that a
big proportion of those projects haven't

3844
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:06,080
big proportion of those projects haven't
 

3845
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,709
big proportion of those projects haven't
yet solved the question of how you're

3846
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
yet solved the question of how you're
 

3847
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,870
yet solved the question of how you're
going to get this deployed right whereas

3848
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:10,880
going to get this deployed right whereas
 

3849
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,950
going to get this deployed right whereas
if you're running a Java project those

3850
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
if you're running a Java project those
 

3851
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,630
if you're running a Java project those
those are mostly I would think you know

3852
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:14,640
those are mostly I would think you know
 

3853
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,030
those are mostly I would think you know
like proportionally more more legacy

3854
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:17,040
like proportionally more more legacy
 

3855
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,870
like proportionally more more legacy
projects might be more objectively but

3856
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
projects might be more objectively but
 

3857
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,630
projects might be more objectively but
they probably the majority of them have

3858
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:20,640
they probably the majority of them have
 

3859
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,870
they probably the majority of them have
already solved these questions in one

3860
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:22,880
already solved these questions in one
 

3861
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,950
already solved these questions in one
way or another yeah yeah if you're

3862
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:24,960
way or another yeah yeah if you're
 

3863
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,870
way or another yeah yeah if you're
spending serious money on Java you

3864
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
spending serious money on Java you
 

3865
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,310
spending serious money on Java you
probably already know what your

3866
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,320
probably already know what your
 

3867
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,750
probably already know what your
deployment stack is yeah yeah yeah well

3868
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:31,760
deployment stack is yeah yeah yeah well
 

3869
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,270
deployment stack is yeah yeah yeah well
in that case it sounds like you've got a

3870
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,280
in that case it sounds like you've got a
 

3871
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,709
in that case it sounds like you've got a
lot of work to do and a lot of market

3872
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:34,719
lot of work to do and a lot of market
 

3873
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,189
lot of work to do and a lot of market
research to do yes absolutely they

3874
01:18:37,189 --> 01:18:37,199
research to do yes absolutely they
 

3875
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,390
research to do yes absolutely they
should probably leave you to go and do

3876
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,400
should probably leave you to go and do
 

3877
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,149
should probably leave you to go and do
it while hopefully a couple of the

3878
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:40,159
it while hopefully a couple of the
 

3879
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:41,830
it while hopefully a couple of the
listeners give you some more data to

3880
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:41,840
listeners give you some more data to
 

3881
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,870
listeners give you some more data to
play with and that more data will force

3882
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:44,880
play with and that more data will force
 

3883
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,110
play with and that more data will force
you to do a data mining project in

3884
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,120
you to do a data mining project in
 

3885
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,470
you to do a data mining project in
Python and we complete the loop

3886
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
Python and we complete the loop
 

3887
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,950
Python and we complete the loop
perfect and on that note Julian thank

3888
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:52,960
perfect and on that note Julian thank
 

3889

there if you're using one of the
 

3901
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,350
there if you're using one of the
languages that Julian mentioned Garnex

3902
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
languages that Julian mentioned Garnex
 

3903
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,189
languages that Julian mentioned Garnex
is actually looking to be a pretty good

3904
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
is actually looking to be a pretty good
 

3905
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,669
is actually looking to be a pretty good
way to get started with Nyx quickly so

3906
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
way to get started with Nyx quickly so
 

3907
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,870
way to get started with Nyx quickly so
you might want to try there before we go

3908
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
you might want to try there before we go
 

3909
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,790
you might want to try there before we go
I'm going to leave you with the single

3910
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:18,800
I'm going to leave you with the single
 

3911
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,790
I'm going to leave you with the single
most terrifying thing that Nyx has

3912
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:20,800
most terrifying thing that Nyx has
 

3913
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,510
most terrifying thing that Nyx has
taught me over the years so Nyx is a

3914
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
taught me over the years so Nyx is a
 

3915
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,270
taught me over the years so Nyx is a
tree of dependencies and it goes all the

3916
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:25,280
tree of dependencies and it goes all the
 

3917
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,550
tree of dependencies and it goes all the
way down to the kernel as we've

3918
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:26,560
way down to the kernel as we've
 

3919
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,390
way down to the kernel as we've
discussed and when you're building

3920
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
discussed and when you're building
 

3921
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,390
discussed and when you're building
something you can look at the logs and

3922
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
something you can look at the logs and
 

3923
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,550
something you can look at the logs and
see that what you're building depends on

3924
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
see that what you're building depends on
 

3925
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,110
see that what you're building depends on
these things and those things depend on

3926
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:35,120
these things and those things depend on
 

3927
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,350
these things and those things depend on
these things and so on all the way down

3928
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:37,360
these things and so on all the way down
 

3929
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,510
these things and so on all the way down
you get the whole dependency tree

3930
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
you get the whole dependency tree
 

3931
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,870
you get the whole dependency tree
staring back at you and I promise you no
