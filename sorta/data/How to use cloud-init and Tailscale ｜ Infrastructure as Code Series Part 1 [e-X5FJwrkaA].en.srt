the first in a series that we're going
 

17
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,790
the first in a series that we're going
to put together over the next few weeks

00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
deploying that machine with terraform
 

27
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,150
deploying that machine with terraform
and after that we'll move on to anible

automatically preconfig your
 

33
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,990
automatically preconfig your
infrastructure to join your tailet then

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
to walk you through the process of
 

71
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,990
to walk you through the process of
creating a virtual machine or a droplet

72
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,000
creating a virtual machine or a droplet
 

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,510
creating a virtual machine or a droplet
as they call it on digital ocean these

74
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
as they call it on digital ocean these
 

75
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,630
as they call it on digital ocean these
droplets support the injection of cloud

text just by copying and pasting it into
 

83
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,789
text just by copying and pasting it into
the digital ocean interface so let's

84
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:25,799
the digital ocean interface so let's
 

85
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,789
the digital ocean interface so let's
jump in and take a look now I've already

video series but today everything is
 

109
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,950
video series but today everything is
manual so we'll need to pick a region

110
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,960
manual so we'll need to pick a region
 

111
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,109
manual so we'll need to pick a region
I'm just going to pick New York because

this kind of matters a little bit like I
 

119
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,469
this kind of matters a little bit like I
don't want to put it in Sy if I live in

120
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
don't want to put it in Sy if I live in
 

121
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,709
don't want to put it in Sy if I live in
the Northern Hemisphere for example but

this list next we're going to want to go
 

135
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,949
this list next we're going to want to go
ahead and pick an OS I almost always

just pick abun to's latest LTS which in

138
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:19,400
just pick abun to's latest LTS which in
 

139
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,110
just pick abun to's latest LTS which in
this case is

140
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
this case is
 

141
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,110
this case is
244 then I'm going to go ahead and

142
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
244 then I'm going to go ahead and
 

143
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,910
244 then I'm going to go ahead and
select the type of droplet that I want

144
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
select the type of droplet that I want
 

145
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,589
select the type of droplet that I want
to create in my case we don't need the

146
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
to create in my case we don't need the
 

147
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,589
to create in my case we don't need the
$32 a month one or we going to need is a

$32 a month one or we going to need is a
 

149
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,430
$32 a month one or we going to need is a
basic $6 a month droplet down here that

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
basic $6 a month droplet down here that
 

151
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,190
basic $6 a month droplet down here that
will suffice for our needs today next up

152
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,200
will suffice for our needs today next up

00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:38,759
remote virtual machine and we should be
 

315
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,670
remote virtual machine and we should be
able to see that tail scale is actually

316
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:40,680
able to see that tail scale is actually
 

317
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,749
able to see that tail scale is actually
already installed on this VM because of

318
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:42,759
already installed on this VM because of
 

319
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,350
already installed on this VM because of
the cloud init stuff that we set up

320
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,360
the cloud init stuff that we set up
 

321
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,110
the cloud init stuff that we set up
earlier and as you can see banana is now

322
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
earlier and as you can see banana is now
 

323
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,749
earlier and as you can see banana is now
a member of my tailet so if we go over

324
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
a member of my tailet so if we go over
 

325
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,950
a member of my tailet so if we go over
here back to my tail scale console go to

326
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:51,960
here back to my tail scale console go to
 

327
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,469
here back to my tail scale console go to
machines we can indeed see that banana

328
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
machines we can indeed see that banana
 

329
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,670
machines we can indeed see that banana
has been set up also note that SSH has

330
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
has been set up also note that SSH has
 

331
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,469
has been set up also note that SSH has
been requested and also has the exit

332
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
been requested and also has the exit
 

333
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,950
been requested and also has the exit
node functionality as well so we could

334
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
node functionality as well so we could
 

335
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,749
node functionality as well so we could
now use this virtual machine we didn't

336
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:04,759
now use this virtual machine we didn't
 

337
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,070
now use this virtual machine we didn't
have to type anything well we have to

338
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,080
have to type anything well we have to
 

339
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,550
have to type anything well we have to
copy and paste our or key but we didn't

340
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
copy and paste our or key but we didn't
 

341
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,430
copy and paste our or key but we didn't
have to do any you know apt get install

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
with my digital ocean API token it's
 

437
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,990
with my digital ocean API token it's
able to go and create those resources

438
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
able to go and create those resources
 

439
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,189
able to go and create those resources
for me in the cloud so what we could

440
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:56,199
for me in the cloud so what we could
 

441
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,430
for me in the cloud so what we could
start to do with this is in part of CI

442
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,440
start to do with this is in part of CI
 

443
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,110
start to do with this is in part of CI
environments we could actually start to

444
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,120
environments we could actually start to
 

445
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,510
environments we could actually start to
sprinkle this stuff into GitHub actions

446
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
sprinkle this stuff into GitHub actions
 

447
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,309
sprinkle this stuff into GitHub actions
or you know Jenkins workflows or

448
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:05,319
or you know Jenkins workflows or
 

449
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,790
or you know Jenkins workflows or
whatever you're using for CI these days

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:07,800
whatever you're using for CI these days
 

451
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,909
whatever you're using for CI these days
we can do this stuff programmatically

452
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
we can do this stuff programmatically
 

453
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,070
we can do this stuff programmatically
and so I'd just like to double check

454
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,080
and so I'd just like to double check
 

455
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,469
and so I'd just like to double check
that everything went okay with my

456
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
that everything went okay with my

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
automation one of the easiest ways to do
 

459
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,110
automation one of the easiest ways to do
this is to jump into the console of the

460
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,120
this is to jump into the console of the
 

461
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,710
this is to jump into the console of the
virtual machine and just try and execute

462
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:17,720
virtual machine and just try and execute
 

463
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,270
virtual machine and just try and execute
a couple of commands so I'm going to

464
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
a couple of commands so I'm going to
 

465
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,430
a couple of commands so I'm going to
jump back to the console of the digital

466
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
jump back to the console of the digital
 

467
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,830
jump back to the console of the digital
ocean droplet type tail scale status and

468
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
ocean droplet type tail scale status and
 

469
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,350
ocean droplet type tail scale status and
we will see that this node is now

470
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:26,360
