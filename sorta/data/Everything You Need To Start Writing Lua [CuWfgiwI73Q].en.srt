00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,950

you're here to learn about Lua so let's

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:02,960
you're here to learn about Lua so let's
 

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,070
you're here to learn about Lua so let's
just go ahead and get started we're

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,080
just go ahead and get started we're
 

5
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,990
just go ahead and get started we're
going to cover all the basic syntax

6
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,000
going to cover all the basic syntax
 

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,150
going to cover all the basic syntax
we're going to cover comments we're

8
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
we're going to cover comments we're
 

9
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,790
we're going to cover comments we're
going to cover all the primary types of

10
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
going to cover all the primary types of
 

11
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,190
going to cover all the primary types of
variables that you're going to use

12
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,200
variables that you're going to use
 

13
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,150
variables that you're going to use
inside of Lua how to define them and how

14
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
inside of Lua how to define them and how
 

15
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,789
inside of Lua how to define them and how
to use them we're going to talk about

16
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:15,799
to use them we're going to talk about
 

17
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:17,830
to use them we're going to talk about
control flow we'll talk a little bit

18
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
control flow we'll talk a little bit
 

19
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,710
control flow we'll talk a little bit
about modules then we'll talk about some

20
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:19,720
about modules then we'll talk about some
 

21
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,509
about modules then we'll talk about some
more advanced function features

22
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:21,519
more advanced function features
 

23
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,950
more advanced function features
following up with some meta tables and

24
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
following up with some meta tables and
 

25
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,990
following up with some meta tables and
then a little bit of bonus for uh for

26
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,000
then a little bit of bonus for uh for
 

27
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,070
then a little bit of bonus for uh for
those of you who make to the end of the

28
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
those of you who make to the end of the
 

29
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,029
those of you who make to the end of the
video before we do that though we need

30
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:28,039
video before we do that though we need
 

31
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,550
video before we do that though we need
to get a little bit of background sorted

32
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:29,560
to get a little bit of background sorted
 

33
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,510
to get a little bit of background sorted
out Lua is elegant it's a beautiful

34
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:32,520
out Lua is elegant it's a beautiful
 

35
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,150
out Lua is elegant it's a beautiful
language and if you think it's not

36
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
language and if you think it's not
 

37
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,869
language and if you think it's not
because it has one-based indexing I've

38
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:35,879
because it has one-based indexing I've
 

39
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:38,190
because it has one-based indexing I've
got a video for you in the description

40
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,200
got a video for you in the description
 

41
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,430
got a video for you in the description
but that's not what we're going to talk

42
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
but that's not what we're going to talk
 

43
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,590
but that's not what we're going to talk
about today Lua a primary idea inside of

44
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:42,600
about today Lua a primary idea inside of
 

45
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,389
about today Lua a primary idea inside of
it is mechanisms over policies which

46
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:45,399
it is mechanisms over policies which
 

47
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,670
it is mechanisms over policies which
means that instead of having special

48
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
means that instead of having special
 

49
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,549
means that instead of having special
keywords for things like classes Lua

50
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
keywords for things like classes Lua
 

51
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,189
keywords for things like classes Lua
allows you to use its simple building

52
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
allows you to use its simple building
 

53
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,790
allows you to use its simple building
blocks to compose more complicated ideas

54
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
blocks to compose more complicated ideas
 

55
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,709
blocks to compose more complicated ideas
so this is it Lua gives you the

56
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
so this is it Lua gives you the
 

57
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,229
so this is it Lua gives you the
mechanisms to implement them instead of

58
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:01,239
mechanisms to implement them instead of
 

59
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,149
mechanisms to implement them instead of
special keywords or special things built

60
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
special keywords or special things built
 

61
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,230
special keywords or special things built
into the language what's beautiful about

62
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
into the language what's beautiful about
 

63
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,510
into the language what's beautiful about
this is that lets us explain all of the

64
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:08,520
this is that lets us explain all of the
 

65
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,910
this is that lets us explain all of the
Practical things you need to know to get

66
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
Practical things you need to know to get
 

67
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,390
Practical things you need to know to get
started with Lua in one video it's very

68
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
started with Lua in one video it's very
 

69
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,310
started with Lua in one video it's very
easy to pick up and very easy to get

70
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
easy to pick up and very easy to get
 

71
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,070
easy to pick up and very easy to get
started it's also designed to be

73
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,830
started it's also designed to be
embedded in this case right here you're

74
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
embedded in this case right here you're
 

75
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,830

neovim program execute Lua live and see

78
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
neovim program execute Lua live and see
 

79
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,950
neovim program execute Lua live and see
the results it's embedded inside of

the results it's embedded inside of
 

81
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,590
the results it's embedded inside of
neovim you might also be here because

82
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
neovim you might also be here because
 

83
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,270

you want to know because you're modding

84
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
you want to know because you're modding
 

85
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,830
you want to know because you're modding
in WoW or something like that I don't

86
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:30,840
in WoW or something like that I don't
 

87
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,590
in WoW or something like that I don't
know L is embedded in a bunch of

88
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:32,600
know L is embedded in a bunch of
 

89
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,550
know L is embedded in a bunch of
different places and I just think it's

90
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
different places and I just think it's
 

91
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,950
different places and I just think it's
really cool I think it really executes

92
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
really cool I think it really executes
 

93
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,190
really cool I think it really executes
well on its design principles and really

94
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,200
well on its design principles and really
 

95
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,149
well on its design principles and really
targets those it knows how to say no

96
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:43,159
targets those it knows how to say no
 

97
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,310
targets those it knows how to say no
which is very important for a language

98
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,320
which is very important for a language

anyways first thing comments it's really

102
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:49,479
anyways first thing comments it's really
 

103
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,469
anyways first thing comments it's really
simple they start with a dash dash it's

104
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,479
simple they start with a dash dash it's
 

105
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,550
simple they start with a dash dash it's
a comment it ends at the end of the line

106
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,560
a comment it ends at the end of the line
 

107
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,270
a comment it ends at the end of the line
you want to do multi-line comments you

108
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
you want to do multi-line comments you
 

109
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,709
you want to do multi-line comments you
got to do Dash Dash and then these

110
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
got to do Dash Dash and then these
 

111
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,190
got to do Dash Dash and then these
little bracket guys we're going to see

112
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,200
little bracket guys we're going to see
 

113
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,830
little bracket guys we're going to see
them again in a moment simple literals

114
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,840
them again in a moment simple literals
 

115
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,469
them again in a moment simple literals
look like this numbers just type the

116
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
look like this numbers just type the
 

117
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,749
look like this numbers just type the
number guys I don't think you really

118
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
number guys I don't think you really
 

119
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,190
number guys I don't think you really
need me to tell you this but basically

120
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
need me to tell you this but basically
 

121
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,670
need me to tell you this but basically
you can sort of think of this as local

122
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:06,680
you can sort of think of this as local
 

123
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,469
you can sort of think of this as local
that says hey don't make this a global

124
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
that says hey don't make this a global
 

125
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,669
that says hey don't make this a global
variable and then this establishes a new

126
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:10,679
variable and then this establishes a new
 

127
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,670
variable and then this establishes a new
name within the current scope then

128
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:12,680
name within the current scope then
 

129
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,869
name within the current scope then
you've got number equals five okay right

130
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
you've got number equals five okay right
 

131
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,990
you've got number equals five okay right
so that sets the number equal to five we

132
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,000
so that sets the number equal to five we
 

133
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,630
so that sets the number equal to five we
have strings with double quotes with

134
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
have strings with double quotes with
 

135
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,070
have strings with double quotes with
single quotes and once again we got the

136
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
single quotes and once again we got the
 

137
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,270
single quotes and once again we got the
little double bracket guys and once

138
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,280
little double bracket guys and once
 

139
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,750
little double bracket guys and once
again this makes something that was

140
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
again this makes something that was
 

141
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,070
again this makes something that was
before a single line kind of construct

142
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
before a single line kind of construct
 

143
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,509
before a single line kind of construct
into something that can stretch over

144
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:27,519
into something that can stretch over
 

145
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,710
into something that can stretch over
multiple lines we've got booleans you

146
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:29,720
multiple lines we've got booleans you
 

147
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,910
multiple lines we've got booleans you
know truth is true and lies is false you

148
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
know truth is true and lies is false you
 

149
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,030
know truth is true and lies is false you
can set multiple values in one line like

150
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,040
can set multiple values in one line like
 

151
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,710
can set multiple values in one line like
this we're going to be returning there

152
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:35,720
this we're going to be returning there
 

153
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,630
this we're going to be returning there
later and last but not Le well actually

154
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
later and last but not Le well actually
 

155
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,670
later and last but not Le well actually
last and least is nothing or the nil

156
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
last and least is nothing or the nil
 

157
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,790
last and least is nothing or the nil
value right so it's nil and you can use

158
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:43,800
value right so it's nil and you can use
 

159
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,470
value right so it's nil and you can use
that as a proper value and there's a few

160
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
that as a proper value and there's a few
 

161
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,869
that as a proper value and there's a few
tricks with that later but we'll come

162
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:47,879
tricks with that later but we'll come
 

163
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,270
tricks with that later but we'll come
back to that too functions are first

164
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,280
back to that too functions are first
 

165
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,470
back to that too functions are first
class in Lu which pretty much just means

166
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
class in Lu which pretty much just means
 

167
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,509
class in Lu which pretty much just means
hey you can make them as values right uh

168
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
hey you can make them as values right uh
 

169
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,270
hey you can make them as values right uh
there's two primary ways we Define them

170
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,280
there's two primary ways we Define them
 

171
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,990
there's two primary ways we Define them
one one is like this where we say a

172
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
one one is like this where we say a
 

173
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,190
one one is like this where we say a
local function name of the function and

174
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,200
local function name of the function and
 

175
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,589
local function name of the function and
then any arguments inside we have the

176
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:04,599
then any arguments inside we have the
 

177
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,910
then any arguments inside we have the
body and then it ends with end Lua

178
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:06,920
body and then it ends with end Lua
 

179
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,430
body and then it ends with end Lua
doesn't use a lot of brackets for

180
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
doesn't use a lot of brackets for
 

181
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,949
doesn't use a lot of brackets for
denoting scope it usually uses words I

182
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:11,959
denoting scope it usually uses words I
 

183
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,430
denoting scope it usually uses words I
think it's kind of pretty I really think

184
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
think it's kind of pretty I really think
 

185
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,309
think it's kind of pretty I really think
you won't notice it after you write it

186
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:15,319
you won't notice it after you write it
 

187
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,589
you won't notice it after you write it
for a little while uh the other way that

188
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
for a little while uh the other way that
 

189
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,869
for a little while uh the other way that
you can Define functions is doing

190
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
you can Define functions is doing
 

191
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,630
you can Define functions is doing
something like this local greet and then

192
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
something like this local greet and then
 

193
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,949
something like this local greet and then
since functions can be values this

194
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
since functions can be values this
 

195
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,670
since functions can be values this
section right here defines a new value

196
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
section right here defines a new value
 

197
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,149
section right here defines a new value
of a function and assigns it to greet

198
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
of a function and assigns it to greet
 

199
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,030
of a function and assigns it to greet
just like we did for these other simp Le

200
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,040
just like we did for these other simp Le
 

201
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,670
just like we did for these other simp Le
values here in this example we've got a

202
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
values here in this example we've got a
 

203
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,309
values here in this example we've got a
higher order function which is just a

204
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:35,319
higher order function which is just a
 

205
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,270
higher order function which is just a
function that returns another function

206
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
function that returns another function
 

207
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,869
function that returns another function
and in this case this function takes in

208
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
and in this case this function takes in
 

209
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,429
and in this case this function takes in
a value and then we use that in our sum

210
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:42,439
a value and then we use that in our sum
 

211
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,270
a value and then we use that in our sum
that we're going to do later so in this

212
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,280
that we're going to do later so in this
 

213
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,910
that we're going to do later so in this
case we have add one we we sort of get

214
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
case we have add one we we sort of get
 

215
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,309
case we have add one we we sort of get
that value from this higher order one

216
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
that value from this higher order one
 

217
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,710
that value from this higher order one
right we which binds value right here

218
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
right we which binds value right here
 

219
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,069
right we which binds value right here
those are called up values you don't

220
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:54,079
those are called up values you don't
 

221
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,350
those are called up values you don't
need to know about that today you can

222
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
need to know about that today you can
 

223
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,030
need to know about that today you can
just think about ah it saves off that

224
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
just think about ah it saves off that
 

225
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,429
just think about ah it saves off that
value so if we execute this we'll see

226
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
value so if we execute this we'll see
 

227
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,470
value so if we execute this we'll see
that the output is add one of

228
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480

 

229
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,830

two that's three okay hopefully you're

230
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
two that's three okay hopefully you're
 

231
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,190
two that's three okay hopefully you're
following along right hopefully that

232
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
following along right hopefully that
 

233
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,190
following along right hopefully that
part wasn't too crazy okay and so that's

234
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,200
part wasn't too crazy okay and so that's
 

235
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,509
part wasn't too crazy okay and so that's
sort of the output of doing that in Lua

236
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
sort of the output of doing that in Lua
 

237
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,990
sort of the output of doing that in Lua
we basically only have one way to store

238
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
we basically only have one way to store
 

239
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,990
we basically only have one way to store
data and that's tables tables are like

240
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,000
data and that's tables tables are like
 

241
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,710
data and that's tables tables are like
lists where you can have you know a

242
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
lists where you can have you know a
 

243
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,430
lists where you can have you know a
sequential index of values and you can

244
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
sequential index of values and you can
 

245
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,390
sequential index of values and you can
iterate over them and store them but

246
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,400
iterate over them and store them but
 

247
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,510
iterate over them and store them but
they're also like Maps or dictionaries

248
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
they're also like Maps or dictionaries
 

249
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,469
they're also like Maps or dictionaries
from python land where you can store

250
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:29,479
from python land where you can store
 

251
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,629
from python land where you can store
different different things inside their

252
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
different different things inside their
 

253
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,830
different different things inside their
keys and map from one value to another

254
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
keys and map from one value to another
 

255
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,150
keys and map from one value to another
so the first thing is we can use tables

256
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
so the first thing is we can use tables
 

257
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,310
so the first thing is we can use tables
like a list so this is like we have the

258
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
like a list so this is like we have the
 

259
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,350
like a list so this is like we have the
first value is first and then two and

260
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,360
first value is first and then two and
 

261
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,390
first value is first and then two and
then false and then a function Lu's

262
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
then false and then a function Lu's
 

263
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,029
then false and then a function Lu's
lists can be heterogeneous right they

264
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:45,039
lists can be heterogeneous right they
 

265
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,870
lists can be heterogeneous right they
can have different values Lua doesn't

266
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
can have different values Lua doesn't
 

267
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,749
can have different values Lua doesn't
care it'll put all of them in a list for

268
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:48,759
care it'll put all of them in a list for
 

269
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,029
care it'll put all of them in a list for
you so if we get the first

270
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:52,039
you so if we get the first
 

271
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:54,830
you so if we get the first
value Yes you heard me write the first

272
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
value Yes you heard me write the first
 

273
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,110
value Yes you heard me write the first
value we're going to get first

274
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,120
value we're going to get first
 

275
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,590
value we're going to get first
hey nice right nice that's what you'd

276
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
hey nice right nice that's what you'd
 

277
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,350
hey nice right nice that's what you'd
expect is because first is the first

278
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
expect is because first is the first
 

279
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,590
expect is because first is the first
thing anyways so now we get fourth is

280
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
thing anyways so now we get fourth is
 

281
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,189
thing anyways so now we get fourth is
four and we print this value uh and we

282
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:08,199
four and we print this value uh and we
 

283
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,670
four and we print this value uh and we
call this function before we do so it

284
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
call this function before we do so it
 

285
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,230
call this function before we do so it
prints right here but that's beside the

286
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,240
prints right here but that's beside the
 

287
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,029
prints right here but that's beside the
point right so we get a function out of

288
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
point right so we get a function out of
 

289
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,830
point right so we get a function out of
the fourth spot so that's tables as

290
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
the fourth spot so that's tables as
 

291
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,950
the fourth spot so that's tables as
lists but we also have tables as Maps

292
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
lists but we also have tables as Maps
 

293
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,390
lists but we also have tables as Maps
there's a few different ways you can

294
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
there's a few different ways you can
 

295
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,510
there's a few different ways you can
write values here you can do a literal

296
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:22,520
write values here you can do a literal
 

297
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,110
write values here you can do a literal
key uh this basically just translates to

298
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,120
key uh this basically just translates to
 

299
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,510
key uh this basically just translates to
the same thing as if you did uh a string

300
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,520
the same thing as if you did uh a string
 

301
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,550
the same thing as if you did uh a string
here except if it doesn't have special

302
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
here except if it doesn't have special
 

303
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,629
here except if it doesn't have special
characters like spaces or like pluses or

304
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:33,639
characters like spaces or like pluses or
 

305
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,350
characters like spaces or like pluses or
ATS or all this other stuff you can just

306
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
ATS or all this other stuff you can just
 

307
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,950
ATS or all this other stuff you can just
write it without the additional quotes

308
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:37,960
write it without the additional quotes
 

309
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,629
write it without the additional quotes
and then sets it equal to a value the

310
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
and then sets it equal to a value the
 

311
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,070
and then sets it equal to a value the
other thing you can do is inside of

312
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080
other thing you can do is inside of
 

313
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,710
other thing you can do is inside of
brackets right here like this you can

314
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
brackets right here like this you can
 

315
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,909
brackets right here like this you can
put any expression you want and then

316
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:46,919
put any expression you want and then
 

317
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,790
put any expression you want and then
that's a key and then you can set a

318
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
that's a key and then you can set a
 

319
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,830
that's a key and then you can set a
value to

320
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
value to
 

321
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,749

here you can even do functions now pause

322
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:54,759
here you can even do functions now pause
 

323
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,870
here you can even do functions now pause
here and

324
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:55,880
here and
 

325
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,469
here and
think pause here and think what is going

326
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
think pause here and think what is going
 

327
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,350
think pause here and think what is going
to get printed here so so this one

328
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
to get printed here so so this one
 

329
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,390
to get printed here so so this one
probably you can guess t. literal key

330
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
probably you can guess t. literal key
 

331
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,670
probably you can guess t. literal key
right that's kind of the same thing as

332
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
right that's kind of the same thing as
 

333
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,950
right that's kind of the same thing as
indexing with a string what do you think

334
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:05,960
indexing with a string what do you think
 

335
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,309
indexing with a string what do you think
is going to get printed for this last

336
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:07,319
is going to get printed for this last
 

337
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,230
is going to get printed for this last
one pause right okay and now execute and

338
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,240
one pause right okay and now execute and
 

339
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,270
one pause right okay and now execute and
you'll see nothing nothing gets printed

340
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
you'll see nothing nothing gets printed
 

341
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,150
you'll see nothing nothing gets printed
here because this function is a

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,830
different function than this Lou doesn't
know what's inside of the functions

346
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
know what's inside of the functions
 

347
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,830
know what's inside of the functions
right it's just sort of like uh by not

348
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
right it's just sort of like uh by not
 

349
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,270
right it's just sort of like uh by not
just like uh whether they're

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
just like uh whether they're
 

351
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,189
just like uh whether they're
referentially trans it doesn't really

matter right these two different things

354
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:26,680
matter right these two different things
 

355
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,390
matter right these two different things
are two different functions because we

356
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
are two different functions because we
 

357
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,950
are two different functions because we
made them two different times so they're

358
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:29,960
made them two different times so they're
 

359
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,870
made them two different times so they're
like different pointers it's not a huge

wanted to point out because it might be

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,270
wanted to point out because it might be
confusing if you expected those to be

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,280
confusing if you expected those to be
 

367
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,909
confusing if you expected those to be
the same because they're the same

368
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
the same because they're the same

we need a new function to help us out

480
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,240
we need a new function to help us out

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,509
we need a new function to help us out
here that function is pairs so I pairs

integer pairs cuz it's the integer
 

487
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,389
integer pairs cuz it's the integer
numbers that we have and then pairs is

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,949
like that so it gives you a little bit

usually it's good to name it a name that

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
usually it's good to name it a name that
 

607
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,910
usually it's good to name it a name that
sort of reflects the thing that you're

619
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,269
whatever is returned from a file if we
removed this return here then this would

620
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:42,279
removed this return here then this would
 

621
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,230

break because nothing gets returned from
 

623
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,829
break because nothing gets returned from
the file so that's like returning

624
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:46,839
the file so that's like returning
 

625
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,550

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,750
nil okay few more things about functions
functions can have multiple return

628
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
functions can have multiple return
 

629
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,829
functions can have multiple return
values which means in this case this one

630
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
values which means in this case this one
 

631
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,110
values which means in this case this one
returns four values 1 2 3 4 and when we

632
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
returns four values 1 2 3 4 and when we
 

633
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,269
returns four values 1 2 3 4 and when we
sort of receive those values or try and

634
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
sort of receive those values or try and
 

635
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,069
sort of receive those values or try and
and place them into something we get

636
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079
and place them into something we get
 

637
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,509
and place them into something we get
first second last in this case so what's

638
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
first second last in this case so what's
 

639
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,190
first second last in this case so what's
going to happen here is the first value

640
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:06,200
going to happen here is the first value
 

641
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,910
going to happen here is the first value
gets put in so that's this one that goes

642
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
gets put in so that's this one that goes
 

643
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,710
gets put in so that's this one that goes
here second goes here third goes here

644
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:09,720
here second goes here third goes here
 

645
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,030
here second goes here third goes here
into last and we discard any additional

646
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,040
into last and we discard any additional
 

647
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,509
into last and we discard any additional
values if you have something here

648
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
values if you have something here
 

649
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,710
values if you have something here
basically Lua is going to let you uh

650
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
basically Lua is going to let you uh
 

651
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,550
basically Lua is going to let you uh
unpack those values until it notices

652
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
unpack those values until it notices
 

653
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,990
unpack those values until it notices
something that's going to take its place

654
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
something that's going to take its place
 

655
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,269
something that's going to take its place
now that probably doesn't make any sense

656
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
now that probably doesn't make any sense
 

657
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,150
now that probably doesn't make any sense
but let's give an example here this

658
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,160
but let's give an example here this
 

659
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,910
but let's give an example here this
function takes a variable amount of

660
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:30,920
function takes a variable amount of
 

661
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,030
function takes a variable amount of
arguments which is denoted by a nice

662
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
arguments which is denoted by a nice
 

663
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,230
arguments which is denoted by a nice
Ellipsis or ellipse I guess is sort of

664
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,240
Ellipsis or ellipse I guess is sort of
 

665
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,949
Ellipsis or ellipse I guess is sort of
the single ellipse I actually don't

666
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
the single ellipse I actually don't
 

667
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,310
the single ellipse I actually don't
remember um and you can place this

668
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
remember um and you can place this
 

669
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,590
remember um and you can place this
inside of some table like this to put

670
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:42,600
inside of some table like this to put
 

671
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,629
inside of some table like this to put
all of the values inside so this is

672
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
all of the values inside so this is
 

673
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,550
all of the values inside so this is
going to say hey take all of the things

674
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
going to say hey take all of the things
 

675
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,710
going to say hey take all of the things
that you put right here right you

676
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
that you put right here right you
 

677
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,750
that you put right here right you
because like you're literally replacing

678
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:50,760
because like you're literally replacing
 

679
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,590
because like you're literally replacing
the text so take all the arguments that

680
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:52,600
the text so take all the arguments that
 

681
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,389
the text so take all the arguments that
you passed here put them here so it's

682
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
you passed here put them here so it's
 

683
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,829
you passed here put them here so it's
like writing hello world and exclamation

684
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:56,839
like writing hello world and exclamation
 

685
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,550
like writing hello world and exclamation
right and that puts it in a table now

686
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
right and that puts it in a table now
 

687
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,430
right and that puts it in a table now
you can see do our ey Pairs and we're

688
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,440
you can see do our ey Pairs and we're
 

689
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,110
you can see do our ey Pairs and we're
printing those and then we're end and

690
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,120
printing those and then we're end and
 

691
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,030
printing those and then we're end and
then we return the arguments back so

692
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,040
then we return the arguments back so
 

693
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,350
then we return the arguments back so
that's not that exciting you know it's

694
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:06,360
that's not that exciting you know it's
 

695
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,030
that's not that exciting you know it's
not a very cool example but in this case

696
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
not a very cool example but in this case
 

697
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,069
not a very cool example but in this case
because there's nothing following the

698
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:11,079
because there's nothing following the
 

699
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,150
because there's nothing following the
call to this variable arguments function

700
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
call to this variable arguments function
 

701
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,150
call to this variable arguments function
it's going to return all of those back

702
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
it's going to return all of those back
 

703
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,509
it's going to return all of those back
to print since print can take multiple

704
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:18,519
to print since print can take multiple
 

705
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,550
to print since print can take multiple
values it's going to print all of those

706
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
values it's going to print all of those
 

707
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,629
values it's going to print all of those
for the second one though notice this is

708
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:23,639
for the second one though notice this is
 

709
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,509
for the second one though notice this is
kind of like there's only one slot to

710
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:26,519
kind of like there's only one slot to
 

711
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,150
kind of like there's only one slot to
put the result of variable arguments so

712
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
put the result of variable arguments so
 

713
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,829
put the result of variable arguments so
take a guess at what's going to happen

714
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
take a guess at what's going to happen
 

715
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,870
take a guess at what's going to happen
based on how we did this before when we

716
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:33,880
based on how we did this before when we
 

717
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,069
based on how we did this before when we
run this for ourselves you'll see that

718
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
run this for ourselves you'll see that
 

719
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,829
run this for ourselves you'll see that
the output here looks like we're going

720
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:38,839
the output here looks like we're going
 

721
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,069
the output here looks like we're going
to print all the arguments one hello two

722
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:41,079
to print all the arguments one hello two
 

723
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,710
to print all the arguments one hello two
world three bang right so that's the

724
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
world three bang right so that's the
 

725
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,389
world three bang right so that's the
same between each but notice how in this

726
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:45,399
same between each but notice how in this
 

727
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,910
same between each but notice how in this
number two we lost the rest of the

728
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
number two we lost the rest of the
 

729
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,710
number two we lost the rest of the
arguments that's because we only have

730
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:49,720
arguments that's because we only have
 

731
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,590
arguments that's because we only have
one slot if you want to call it that to

732
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
one slot if you want to call it that to
 

733
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,470
one slot if you want to call it that to
place the uh the value okay so that

734
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
place the uh the value okay so that
 

735
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,150
place the uh the value okay so that
means we just discarded the rest of the

736
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
means we just discarded the rest of the
 

737
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,230
means we just discarded the rest of the
arguments that's kind of a thing it's

738
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
arguments that's kind of a thing it's
 

739
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,550
arguments that's kind of a thing it's
just going to let you discard stuff

740
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:01,560
just going to let you discard stuff
 

741
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,870
just going to let you discard stuff
that's totally

742
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:02,880
that's totally
 

743
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,509
that's totally
fine and the another thing that we need

744
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
fine and the another thing that we need
 

745
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,150
fine and the another thing that we need
to talk about for functions is how you

746
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,160
to talk about for functions is how you
 

747
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,350
to talk about for functions is how you
can call them obviously you can call

748
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
can call them obviously you can call
 

749
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,910
can call them obviously you can call
them with parenthesis we've already done

750
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:10,920
them with parenthesis we've already done
 

751
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,870
them with parenthesis we've already done
this the parentheses go here not like a

752
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
this the parentheses go here not like a
 

753
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,590
this the parentheses go here not like a
list where they go beforehand but if

754
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:16,600
list where they go beforehand but if
 

755
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,670
list where they go beforehand but if
there's only one argument that you're

756
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:18,680
there's only one argument that you're
 

757
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,629
there's only one argument that you're
passing and it's a string literal you

758
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:21,639
passing and it's a string literal you
 

759
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,470
passing and it's a string literal you
can actually drop the parentheses and

760
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:23,480
can actually drop the parentheses and
 

761
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,749
can actually drop the parentheses and
just go something like this single

762
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:24,759
just go something like this single
 

763
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,030
just go something like this single
string high and if you run this you'll

764
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
string high and if you run this you'll
 

765
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,749
string high and if you run this you'll
see that these two values are exactly

766
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:28,759
see that these two values are exactly
 

767
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,670
see that these two values are exactly
the same no errors so sometimes you'll

768
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:30,680
the same no errors so sometimes you'll
 

769
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,710
the same no errors so sometimes you'll
see this um dropped with the parentheses

770
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:33,720
see this um dropped with the parentheses
 

771
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,030
see this um dropped with the parentheses
when there's one string I don't do it as

772
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,040
when there's one string I don't do it as
 

773
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,310
when there's one string I don't do it as
often for Strings but I do it very often

774
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
often for Strings but I do it very often
 

775
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,670
often for Strings but I do it very often
for this scenario which you can do the

776
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:40,680
for this scenario which you can do the
 

777
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,550
for this scenario which you can do the
same thing for tables I usually do this

778
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
same thing for tables I usually do this
 

779
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,110
same thing for tables I usually do this
most often when I want to sort of

780
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
most often when I want to sort of
 

781
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,470
most often when I want to sort of
emulate um like optional or default

782
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
emulate um like optional or default
 

783
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,749
emulate um like optional or default
default arguments Lua doesn't have those

784
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:52,759
default arguments Lua doesn't have those
 

785
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,470
default arguments Lua doesn't have those
once again doesn't have a policy for how

786
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
once again doesn't have a policy for how
 

787
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,710
once again doesn't have a policy for how
you would Define uh what are optional

788
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
you would Define uh what are optional
 

789
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,749
you would Define uh what are optional
arguments or default arguments or how

790
00:14:59,749 --> 00:14:59,759
arguments or default arguments or how
 

791
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,150
arguments or default arguments or how
you would say it's required but it has

792
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,160
you would say it's required but it has
 

793
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,710
you would say it's required but it has
this doesn't have that idea instead what

794
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:03,720
this doesn't have that idea instead what
 

795
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,030
this doesn't have that idea instead what
you can do is sort of emulate this by

796
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
you can do is sort of emulate this by
 

797
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,230
you can do is sort of emulate this by
directly passing a table with no

798
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,240
directly passing a table with no
 

799
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,790
directly passing a table with no
parentheses and it looks like you're

800
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:11,800
parentheses and it looks like you're
 

801
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,910
parentheses and it looks like you're
calling it with something like oh

802
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
calling it with something like oh
 

803
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,670
calling it with something like oh
default is 12 and others false right and

804
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:16,680
default is 12 and others false right and
 

805
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,310
default is 12 and others false right and
in this case we can check inside of this

806
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:19,320
in this case we can check inside of this
 

807
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,470
in this case we can check inside of this
function oh did we pass a default value

808
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:21,480
function oh did we pass a default value
 

809
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,870
function oh did we pass a default value
right so if we didn't pass one it'll be

810
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
right so if we didn't pass one it'll be
 

811
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,629
right so if we didn't pass one it'll be
nil okay then we'll set ops. default

812
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:25,639
nil okay then we'll set ops. default
 

813
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,829
nil okay then we'll set ops. default
equal 17 and then we can print these two

814
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
equal 17 and then we can print these two
 

815
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,670
equal 17 and then we can print these two
not the most exciting function but when

816
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
not the most exciting function but when
 

817
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,269
not the most exciting function but when
we do this sorry for smashing the

818
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
we do this sorry for smashing the
 

819
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,590
we do this sorry for smashing the
microphone you'll see that 12 and false

820
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:34,600
microphone you'll see that 12 and false
 

821
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,230
microphone you'll see that 12 and false
right so that's our default 12 and

822
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
right so that's our default 12 and
 

823
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,670
right so that's our default 12 and
others false or right for our second

824
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:38,680
others false or right for our second
 

825
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,710
others false or right for our second
option other is true we didn't pass def

826
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
option other is true we didn't pass def
 

827
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,710
option other is true we didn't pass def
fault so we get 17 true so that's the

828
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:43,720
fault so we get 17 true so that's the
 

829
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,629
fault so we get 17 true so that's the
two other ways that you might see people

830
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:45,639
two other ways that you might see people
 

831
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,790
two other ways that you might see people
calling functions which is definitely

832
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:47,800
calling functions which is definitely
 

833
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,670
calling functions which is definitely
surprising the first time that you see

834
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
surprising the first time that you see
 

835
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,309
surprising the first time that you see
these parentheses dropped and it just

836
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:51,319
these parentheses dropped and it just
 

837
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:53,110
these parentheses dropped and it just
looks like people are coming up with

838
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
looks like people are coming up with
 

839
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,350
looks like people are coming up with
their own magic stuff this only works

840
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
their own magic stuff this only works
 

841
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,949
their own magic stuff this only works
for literal strings and literal tables

842
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:57,959
for literal strings and literal tables
 

843
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,269
for literal strings and literal tables
those are the only times that works so

844
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
those are the only times that works so
 

845
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,949
those are the only times that works so
we have one other sort of uh Edge

846
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:03,959
we have one other sort of uh Edge
 

847
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,470
we have one other sort of uh Edge
scenario to consider for functions which

848
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
scenario to consider for functions which
 

849
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,749
scenario to consider for functions which
is when we Define a function on a table

850
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
is when we Define a function on a table
 

851
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,150
is when we Define a function on a table
so let's say we have some table like

852
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,160
so let's say we have some table like
 

853
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,749
so let's say we have some table like
this if we do a DOT right then we have a

854
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
this if we do a DOT right then we have a
 

855
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,269
this if we do a DOT right then we have a
list of arguments here so we can write

856
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
list of arguments here so we can write
 

857
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,309
list of arguments here so we can write
function uh you know like the table name

858
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:19,319
function uh you know like the table name
 

859
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,389
function uh you know like the table name
dot something else and then these two

860
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
dot something else and then these two
 

861
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,509
dot something else and then these two
things are actually equivalent so this

862
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
things are actually equivalent so this
 

863
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,150
things are actually equivalent so this
colon sort of magically creates this is

864
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
colon sort of magically creates this is
 

865
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,670
colon sort of magically creates this is
like the only syntax sugar that Lua has

866
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
like the only syntax sugar that Lua has
 

867
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,150
like the only syntax sugar that Lua has
and usually people use this to Define

868
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
and usually people use this to Define
 

869
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,189
and usually people use this to Define
like some sort of object system or

870
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:36,199
like some sort of object system or
 

871
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,150
like some sort of object system or
inheritance or to use something about

872
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
inheritance or to use something about
 

873
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,509
inheritance or to use something about
the table itself um but if you see this

874
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
the table itself um but if you see this
 

875
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,309
the table itself um but if you see this
coal in here all that does is it's

876
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:44,319
coal in here all that does is it's
 

877
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,749
coal in here all that does is it's
translating this idea into this idea

878
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
translating this idea into this idea
 

879
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,230
translating this idea into this idea
okay and and really it's just saying uh

880
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
okay and and really it's just saying uh
 

881
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,030
okay and and really it's just saying uh
I'm going to call something on my table

882
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,040
I'm going to call something on my table
 

883
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,829
I'm going to call something on my table
where the first argument is going to be

884
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
where the first argument is going to be
 

885
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,949
where the first argument is going to be
like inserted as self and it will be the

886
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
like inserted as self and it will be the
 

887
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,309
like inserted as self and it will be the
table that I'm calling we'll see an

888
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:00,319
table that I'm calling we'll see an
 

889
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,069
table that I'm calling we'll see an
example of this shortly in metat table

890
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
example of this shortly in metat table
 

891
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,549
example of this shortly in metat table
so if that didn't make sense just uh

892
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
so if that didn't make sense just uh
 

893
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,470
so if that didn't make sense just uh
just keep that in mind that this colon

894
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
just keep that in mind that this colon
 

895
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,549
just keep that in mind that this colon
is just syntax sugar for DOT and self

896
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
is just syntax sugar for DOT and self
 

897
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,750
is just syntax sugar for DOT and self
okay all right so metat tables metat

898
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
okay all right so metat tables metat
 

899
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,949
okay all right so metat tables metat
tables

900
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
tables
 

901
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,110
tables
are you know like it's a thing about

902
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
are you know like it's a thing about
 

903
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,870
are you know like it's a thing about
tables right that's the meta and the

904
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
tables right that's the meta and the
 

905
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,510
tables right that's the meta and the
tables they describe or change the

906
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
tables they describe or change the
 

907
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,549
tables they describe or change the
behavior of tables uh this is really

908
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
behavior of tables uh this is really
 

909
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,230
behavior of tables uh this is really
similar to like thunder methods in

910
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,240
similar to like thunder methods in
 

911
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,549
similar to like thunder methods in
python or like how you would Implement

912
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:31,559
python or like how you would Implement
 

913
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,630
python or like how you would Implement
different traits maybe in Rust right

914
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:33,640
different traits maybe in Rust right
 

915
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,310
different traits maybe in Rust right
which is that basically what we can do

916
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:35,320
which is that basically what we can do
 

917
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,950
which is that basically what we can do
is we can say hey I will give you a

918
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:37,960
is we can say hey I will give you a
 

919
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,470
is we can say hey I will give you a
table and it will describe what you

920
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
table and it will describe what you
 

921
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,150
table and it will describe what you
should do under various scenarios uh

922
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
should do under various scenarios uh
 

923
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,870
should do under various scenarios uh
within the language the first one we'll

924
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:45,880
within the language the first one we'll
 

925
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,909
within the language the first one we'll
do which is the really simplest one is

926
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
do which is the really simplest one is
 

927
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,630
do which is the really simplest one is
ADD so right down here we're going to

928
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
ADD so right down here we're going to
 

929
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,190
ADD so right down here we're going to
add two tables normally that would be

930
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
add two tables normally that would be
 

931
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,470
add two tables normally that would be
bad you can't just do like Lua table

932
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
bad you can't just do like Lua table
 

933
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,230
bad you can't just do like Lua table
plus table that's not good okay if we

934
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
plus table that's not good okay if we
 

935
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,350
plus table that's not good okay if we
just like try and add these it says hey

936
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:02,360
just like try and add these it says hey
 

937
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,310
just like try and add these it says hey
you just tried to perform arithmetic on

938
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
you just tried to perform arithmetic on
 

939
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,549
you just tried to perform arithmetic on
table values no no no don't do that so

940
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
table values no no no don't do that so
 

941
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,870
table values no no no don't do that so
instead we need to define a way for how

942
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:11,880
instead we need to define a way for how
 

943
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,950
instead we need to define a way for how
we could add two tables and in this case

944
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
we could add two tables and in this case
 

945
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,149
we could add two tables and in this case
we sort of have an idea of a vector you

946
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:17,159
we sort of have an idea of a vector you
 

947
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,710
we sort of have an idea of a vector you
know like some Vector three and each of

948
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:19,720
know like some Vector three and each of
 

949
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,310
know like some Vector three and each of
them has three values right and we're

950
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
them has three values right and we're
 

951
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,990
them has three values right and we're
going to tell it hey here's what I want

952
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,000
going to tell it hey here's what I want
 

953
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,549
going to tell it hey here's what I want
you to do when I add these two items

954
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
you to do when I add these two items
 

955
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,909
you to do when I add these two items
right so it's like left and right so

956
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:30,919
right so it's like left and right so
 

957
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,029
right so it's like left and right so
this V3 is the result of V1 + V2 and if

958
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
this V3 is the result of V1 + V2 and if
 

959
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,310
this V3 is the result of V1 + V2 and if
we execute this you'll see that hey V3

960
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
we execute this you'll see that hey V3
 

961
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,789
we execute this you'll see that hey V3
V3 right here 1 two 3 right so if we add

962
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:41,799
V3 right here 1 two 3 right so if we add
 

963
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,230
V3 right here 1 two 3 right so if we add
these two values these are going to

964
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,240
these two values these are going to
 

965
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,029
these two values these are going to
cancel out that's the zero and we have

966
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
cancel out that's the zero and we have
 

967
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,029
cancel out that's the zero and we have
one and two that's three and then five

968
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
one and two that's three and then five
 

969
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,830
one and two that's three and then five
and two that's seven and then if we

970
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
and two that's seven and then if we
 

971
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,390
and two that's seven and then if we
added V3 to itself that should work just

972
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
added V3 to itself that should work just
 

973
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,870
added V3 to itself that should work just
fine too if we print the whole table

974
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:53,880
fine too if we print the whole table
 

975
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,350
fine too if we print the whole table
we'll see 0 6 and 14 right which is

976
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:56,360
we'll see 0 6 and 14 right which is
 

977
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,789
we'll see 0 6 and 14 right which is
basically doubling all of these and L

978
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
basically doubling all of these and L
 

979
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,549
basically doubling all of these and L

here needs to do something besides the
 

987
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,950
here needs to do something besides the
normal thing that it does when you try

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:09,960
normal thing that it does when you try

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,789
normal thing that it does when you try
and add two tables which is throw an

are usually called meta methods because

994
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
are usually called meta methods because
 

995
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,870
are usually called meta methods because
they're things on a table that we can do

996
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:19,880
they're things on a table that we can do
 

997
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,830
they're things on a table that we can do
the other one that's kind of cool in

998
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
the other one that's kind of cool in
 

999
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,190
the other one that's kind of cool in
this scenario that I wanted to go over

1000
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,200
this scenario that I wanted to go over
 

1001
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,669
this scenario that I wanted to go over
is called index so index is called

1002
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
is called index so index is called
 

1003
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,549
is called index so index is called
whenever you try try to get a value from

1004
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
whenever you try try to get a value from
 

1005
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,750
whenever you try try to get a value from
a table that does not exist so in this

1006
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
a table that does not exist so in this
 

1007
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,270
a table that does not exist so in this
case we create an empty table and we set

1008
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,280
case we create an empty table and we set
 

1009
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,310
case we create an empty table and we set
its metat table to this Fibonacci metat

1010
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
its metat table to this Fibonacci metat
 

1011
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,950
its metat table to this Fibonacci metat
table we just made and this key is the

1012
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:43,960
table we just made and this key is the
 

1013
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,549
table we just made and this key is the
value that we're looking for right so

1014
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:45,559
value that we're looking for right so
 

1015
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,390
value that we're looking for right so
when I call FIB five this doesn't have

1016
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:49,400
when I call FIB five this doesn't have
 

1017
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,950
when I call FIB five this doesn't have
FIB five right it's not it's not around

1018
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
FIB five right it's not it's not around
 

1019
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,830
FIB five right it's not it's not around
there's nothing set inside of the table

1020
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:54,840
there's nothing set inside of the table
 

1021
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,029
there's nothing set inside of the table
already so it's going to call this

1022
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
already so it's going to call this
 

1023
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,270
already so it's going to call this
function it will then check these and it

1024
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
function it will then check these and it
 

1025
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,390
function it will then check these and it
says the key is not less than two okay

1026
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:01,400
says the key is not less than two okay
 

1027
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,110
says the key is not less than two okay
so I'm not going to return and then what

1028
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
so I'm not going to return and then what
 

1029
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,510
so I'm not going to return and then what
it's going to do it's going to update

1030
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:04,520
it's going to do it's going to update
 

1031
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,710
it's going to do it's going to update
the table and it's going to call these

1032
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
the table and it's going to call these
 

1033
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,750
the table and it's going to call these
functions and funny enough in this case

1034
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
functions and funny enough in this case
 

1035
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,750
functions and funny enough in this case
we're actually showing how this can be

1036
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
we're actually showing how this can be
 

1037
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,270
we're actually showing how this can be
recursively called right it's going to

1038
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,280
recursively called right it's going to
 

1039
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,950
recursively called right it's going to
look for self key minus 2 and it's going

1040
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
look for self key minus 2 and it's going
 

1041
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,870
look for self key minus 2 and it's going
to do the normal Fibonacci thing that I

1042
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:19,880
to do the normal Fibonacci thing that I
 

1043
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,350
to do the normal Fibonacci thing that I
think most of you probably know but the

1044
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,360
think most of you probably know but the
 

1045
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,430
think most of you probably know but the
like cheeky cute result here is that

1046
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
like cheeky cute result here is that
 

1047
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,950
like cheeky cute result here is that
we're caching these sort of

1048
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:27,960
we're caching these sort of
 

1049
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,710
we're caching these sort of
automatically inside of here because

1050
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:29,720
automatically inside of here because
 

1051
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,110
automatically inside of here because
we're updating this table that's what

1052
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
we're updating this table that's what
 

1053
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,310
we're updating this table that's what
self is this is like if we go back a few

1054
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
self is this is like if we go back a few
 

1055
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,950
self is this is like if we go back a few
pages here where we talked about the

1056
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
pages here where we talked about the
 

1057
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,950
pages here where we talked about the
colon argument where did I already go

1058
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
colon argument where did I already go
 

1059
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,470
colon argument where did I already go
past it was I not paying attention I

1060
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
past it was I not paying attention I
 

1061
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,830
past it was I not paying attention I
already went past it I wasn't paying

1062
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
already went past it I wasn't paying
 

1063
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,350
already went past it I wasn't paying
attention sorry right here this self is

1064
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
attention sorry right here this self is
 

1065
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,310
attention sorry right here this self is
the table that the method is getting

1066
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
the table that the method is getting
 

1067
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,510
the table that the method is getting
called on okay so this self is actually

1068
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:54,520
called on okay so this self is actually
 

1069
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,510
called on okay so this self is actually
this table so when we update its value

1070
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
this table so when we update its value
 

1071
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,190
this table so when we update its value
we're saving or caching these values

1072
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,200
we're saving or caching these values
 

1073
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,710
we're saving or caching these values
along the way so instead of taking

1074
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
along the way so instead of taking
 

1075
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,990
along the way so instead of taking
forever to calculate FIB 1000 we can

1076
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
forever to calculate FIB 1000 we can
 

1077
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,630
forever to calculate FIB 1000 we can
execute it practically instantly because

1078
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
execute it practically instantly because
 

1079
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,750
execute it practically instantly because
we're going to save the values along the

1080
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:10,760
we're going to save the values along the
 

1081
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,390
we're going to save the values along the
way right you can use a bunch of

1082
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
way right you can use a bunch of
 

1083
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,870
way right you can use a bunch of
different options for this you could

1084
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:13,880
different options for this you could
 

1085
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,029
different options for this you could
like calculate default values that might

1086
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:16,039
like calculate default values that might
 

1087
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,710
like calculate default values that might
be expensive or provide something that

1088
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
be expensive or provide something that
 

1089
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,149
be expensive or provide something that
always doubles a key whatever you want

1090
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:21,159
always doubles a key whatever you want
 

1091
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,710
always doubles a key whatever you want
it's a function you can write the code

1092
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:23,720
it's a function you can write the code
 

1093
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,110
it's a function you can write the code
uh the other two notable meta methods we

1094
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,120
uh the other two notable meta methods we
 

1095
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,909
uh the other two notable meta methods we
should talk about are new index new

1096
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:28,919
should talk about are new index new
 

1097
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,149
should talk about are new index new
index actually gets called when we're

1098
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:31,159
index actually gets called when we're
 

1099
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,710
index actually gets called when we're
right here which is self key and then

1100
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
right here which is self key and then
 

1101
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,669
right here which is self key and then
value so that's sort of like self key

1102
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
value so that's sort of like self key
 

1103
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,070
value so that's sort of like self key
and value those are the things that

1104
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,080
and value those are the things that
 

1105
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,590
and value those are the things that
would get called so you can actually

1106
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:40,600
would get called so you can actually
 

1107
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,909
would get called so you can actually
override what happens when you do new

1108
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:42,919
override what happens when you do new
 

1109
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,669
override what happens when you do new
index uh you could create like a locked

1110
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
index uh you could create like a locked
 

1111
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,110
index uh you could create like a locked
table that just errors inside of new

1112
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,120
table that just errors inside of new
 

1113
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,789
table that just errors inside of new
index and you don't allow it the other

1114
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
index and you don't allow it the other
 

1115
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,909
index and you don't allow it the other
one that's kind of cool is call which

1116
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:52,919
one that's kind of cool is call which
 

1117
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,549
one that's kind of cool is call which
lets you call a table as a function so

1118
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
lets you call a table as a function so
 

1119
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,870
lets you call a table as a function so
you could like store some state sore

1120
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
you could like store some state sore
 

1121
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,549
you could like store some state sore
some mutable State and call function on

1122
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
some mutable State and call function on
 

1123
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,510
some mutable State and call function on
it you'll see this one used um a bit as

1124
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:02,520
it you'll see this one used um a bit as
 

1125
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,350
it you'll see this one used um a bit as
well a little less off than then index

1126
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
well a little less off than then index
 

1127
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,390
well a little less off than then index
and new index so some quick neovim

1128
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
and new index so some quick neovim
 

1129
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,430
and new index so some quick neovim
goodies because now you actually know

1130
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
goodies because now you actually know
 

1131
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,149
goodies because now you actually know
basically everything you need to do to

1132
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:13,159
basically everything you need to do to
 

1133
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:15,590
basically everything you need to do to
get started writing Lua that's it that's

1134
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
get started writing Lua that's it that's
 

1135
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,590
get started writing Lua that's it that's
pretty much the whole language okay it's

1136
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:18,600
pretty much the whole language okay it's
 

1137
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,470
pretty much the whole language okay it's
really cool here's a few things you can

1138
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
really cool here's a few things you can
 

1139
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,269
really cool here's a few things you can
do I like these key mappings for myself

1140
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:23,279
do I like these key mappings for myself
 

1141
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,590
do I like these key mappings for myself
so you can do Vim keymap set space xx

1142
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:26,600
so you can do Vim keymap set space xx
 

1143
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,590
so you can do Vim keymap set space xx
and that sources a file so let's yo this

1144
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
and that sources a file so let's yo this
 

1145
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,950
and that sources a file so let's yo this
and we'll do our same um we'll do our

1146
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:33,960
and we'll do our same um we'll do our
 

1147
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,669
and we'll do our same um we'll do our
same sort of thing that we did last time

1148
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:36,679
same sort of thing that we did last time
 

1149
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:38,549
same sort of thing that we did last time
in the series which was I had my envm

1150
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
in the series which was I had my envm
 

1151
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,350
in the series which was I had my envm
example here and I opened up my init Lua

1152
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
example here and I opened up my init Lua
 

1153
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,470
example here and I opened up my init Lua
these are not that exciting uh functions

1154
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:43,480
these are not that exciting uh functions
 

1155
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,070
these are not that exciting uh functions
so we're going to we'll keep the print

1156
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,080
so we're going to we'll keep the print
 

1157
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,950
so we're going to we'll keep the print
just so we know what's happening here

1158
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
just so we know what's happening here
 

1159
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,590
just so we know what's happening here
and if I Source this file what we're

1160
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:50,600
and if I Source this file what we're
 

1161
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,029
and if I Source this file what we're
going to see now is that we actually

1162
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
going to see now is that we actually
 

1163
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,870
going to see now is that we actually
have this key map set for us so if we do

1164
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
have this key map set for us so if we do
 

1165
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,390
have this key map set for us so if we do
no no remap uh space to see what we have

1166
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:57,400
no no remap uh space to see what we have
 

1167
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,789
no no remap uh space to see what we have
we see space space X sources the file so

1168
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
we see space space X sources the file so
 

1169
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,230
we see space space X sources the file so
when I press space space X it prints

1170
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
when I press space space X it prints
 

1171
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,830
when I press space space X it prints
Advent of neovim if I had you know one

1172
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
Advent of neovim if I had you know one
 

1173
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,310
Advent of neovim if I had you know one
two three like this and I go space space

1174
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:11,320
two three like this and I go space space
 

1175
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,590
two three like this and I go space space
X it's going to execute the file and run

1176
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:14,600
X it's going to execute the file and run
 

1177
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,630
X it's going to execute the file and run
everything inside of it okay so that's

1178
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
everything inside of it okay so that's
 

1179
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,830
everything inside of it okay so that's
pretty cool but something that we could

1180
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:18,840
pretty cool but something that we could
 

1181
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,070
pretty cool but something that we could
do instead as well that I think is

1182
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,080
do instead as well that I think is
 

1183
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,390
do instead as well that I think is
really nice is sometimes you want to

1184
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
really nice is sometimes you want to
 

1185
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,710
really nice is sometimes you want to
execute something that's just like the

1186
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
execute something that's just like the
 

1187
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,350
execute something that's just like the
current line so we could put this in

1188
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
current line so we could put this in
 

1189
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,549
current line so we could put this in
here and I'll say my file and run space

1190
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:29,559
here and I'll say my file and run space
 

1191
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,789
here and I'll say my file and run space
space X to execute the file again now I

1192
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
space X to execute the file again now I
 

1193
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,870
space X to execute the file again now I
have space X to run just the current

1194
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
have space X to run just the current
 

1195
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,110
have space X to run just the current
line see how this is running whatever is

1196
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
line see how this is running whatever is
 

1197
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,390
line see how this is running whatever is
on the current line that I'm doing I'm

1198
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
on the current line that I'm doing I'm
 

1199
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,070
on the current line that I'm doing I'm
just pressing Space X here to do that uh

1200
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,080
just pressing Space X here to do that uh
 

1201
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,310
just pressing Space X here to do that uh
unrelated to um Space X the company but

1202
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
unrelated to um Space X the company but
 

1203
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,350
unrelated to um Space X the company but
obviously if uh if we could get

1204
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,360
obviously if uh if we could get
 

1205
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,350
obviously if uh if we could get
sponsored for just making key maps do

1206
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:48,360
sponsored for just making key maps do
 

1207
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,549

that that would be super cool uh the

1208
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
that that would be super cool uh the
 

1209
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,149
that that would be super cool uh the
last one that's really cool that I want

to show you is we can do I'm just going
 

1213

my selection these are really powerful

1220
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
my selection these are really powerful
 

1221
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,710
my selection these are really powerful
as we start to build more and more of

as we start to build more and more of
 

1223
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,909
as we start to build more and more of

our neovim config we don't want to
 

1225
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,029
our neovim config we don't want to
completely reset neovim every time we

1226
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:12,039
completely reset neovim every time we
 

1227
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,430
completely reset neovim every time we
want to make a change we can use this

1228
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:14,440
want to make a change we can use this
 

1229
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,029
want to make a change we can use this
building block of uh keymaps to quickly

1230
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:18,039
building block of uh keymaps to quickly

execute what we're working on and use

1232
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
execute what we're working on and use
 

1233
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,390
execute what we're working on and use
neovim in a live setting and these ideas

1234
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
neovim in a live setting and these ideas
 

1235
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,710
neovim in a live setting and these ideas
are basically how I was doing things

1236
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
are basically how I was doing things
 

1237
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,430
are basically how I was doing things
along the way to do cool stuff of

1238
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
along the way to do cool stuff of
 

1239
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,029
along the way to do cool stuff of
running this I just put it into you know

1240
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:30,039
running this I just put it into you know
 

1241
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,630
running this I just put it into you know
sort of a special uh buffer to look cool

1242
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
sort of a special uh buffer to look cool
 

1243
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,430
sort of a special uh buffer to look cool
so that you guys could see this the last

1244
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,440
so that you guys could see this the last
 

1245
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,190
so that you guys could see this the last
one that I'll do which I want to show

1246
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:36,200
one that I'll do which I want to show
 

1247
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,190
one that I'll do which I want to show
you is um is how we can use Auto

1248
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,200
you is um is how we can use Auto
 

1249
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,789
you is um is how we can use Auto
commands and a few of the other things

1250
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:41,799
commands and a few of the other things
 

1251
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,669
commands and a few of the other things
and how with just the tools that we've

1252
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
and how with just the tools that we've
 

1253
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,990
and how with just the tools that we've
learned so far today in

1254
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
learned so far today in
 

1255
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,430
learned so far today in
this 24 minute video that's longer than

1256
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:48,440
this 24 minute video that's longer than
 

1257
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,590
this 24 minute video that's longer than
I thought but that's okay uh 24 minute

1258
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:50,600
I thought but that's okay uh 24 minute
 

1259
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,950
I thought but that's okay uh 24 minute
video we should be able to understand

1260
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
video we should be able to understand
 

1261
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,909
video we should be able to understand
everything that's happening in this

1262
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:54,919
everything that's happening in this
 

1263
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,750
everything that's happening in this
chunk of code right so let's do that

1264
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
chunk of code right so let's do that
 

1265
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,470
chunk of code right so let's do that
we'll walk through it but sort of think

1266
00:24:59,470 --> 00:24:59,480
we'll walk through it but sort of think
 

1267
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,710
we'll walk through it but sort of think
ahead of me maybe pause even read

1268
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:01,720
ahead of me maybe pause even read
 

1269
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,470
ahead of me maybe pause even read
through this code and then we'll work

1270
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,480
through this code and then we'll work
 

1271
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,430
through this code and then we'll work
through it together okay so paused okay

1272
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
through it together okay so paused okay
 

1273
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,230
through it together okay so paused okay
now we resume all right so in this case

1274
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
now we resume all right so in this case
 

1275
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,190
now we resume all right so in this case
we're going to use a Vim this looks like

1276
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
we're going to use a Vim this looks like
 

1277
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,590
we're going to use a Vim this looks like
a table because we got vim and then we

1278
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
a table because we got vim and then we
 

1279
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,789
a table because we got vim and then we
have API so we're accessing the API

1280
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
have API so we're accessing the API
 

1281
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,110
have API so we're accessing the API
field in vim and then we're going to

1282
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
field in vim and then we're going to
 

1283
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,710
field in vim and then we're going to
access the envm create autoc command

1284
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:21,720
access the envm create autoc command
 

1285
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,830
access the envm create autoc command
field in API right so we basically have

1286
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
field in API right so we basically have
 

1287
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,110
field in API right so we basically have
something like if you did Lua equals Vim

1288
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,120
something like if you did Lua equals Vim
 

1289
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,950
something like if you did Lua equals Vim
you can see it's a really big Global

1290
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:27,960
you can see it's a really big Global
 

1291
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,510
you can see it's a really big Global
with all of the different functions

1292
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
with all of the different functions
 

1293
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,750
with all of the different functions
available this is sort of like the Vim

1294
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
available this is sort of like the Vim
 

1295
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,430
available this is sort of like the Vim
Library automatically loaded in you can

1296
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:34,440
Library automatically loaded in you can
 

1297
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,190
Library automatically loaded in you can
do Lua equals vm. API and you can see

1298
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
do Lua equals vm. API and you can see
 

1299
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,750
do Lua equals vm. API and you can see
hey here's a bunch of different

1300
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:38,760
hey here's a bunch of different
 

1301
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,590
hey here's a bunch of different
functions and then we can even do Lua

1302
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,600
functions and then we can even do Lua
 

1303
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,950
functions and then we can even do Lua
vm. api. envm create auto command and

1304
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
vm. api. envm create auto command and
 

1305
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,510
vm. api. envm create auto command and
you'll see that that's a function you

1306
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,520
you'll see that that's a function you
 

1307
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,549
you'll see that that's a function you
say great we've got a function what are

1308
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
say great we've got a function what are
 

1309
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,590
say great we've got a function what are
we going to do here now if you don't

1310
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:50,600
we going to do here now if you don't
 

1311
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,310
we going to do here now if you don't
know what this function does inside of

1312
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,320
know what this function does inside of
 

1313
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,669
know what this function does inside of
new of him you should really try

1314
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
new of him you should really try
 

1315
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,190
new of him you should really try
something like this Auto Command right

1316
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,200
something like this Auto Command right
 

1317
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,789
something like this Auto Command right
cool now we can read The Help It says

1318
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:57,799
cool now we can read The Help It says
 

1319
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,389
cool now we can read The Help It says
creates an autoc command event handler

1320
00:25:59,389 --> 00:25:59,399
creates an autoc command event handler
 

1321
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:01,710
creates an autoc command event handler
divined by callback or command and then

1322
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:01,720
divined by callback or command and then
 

1323
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,510
divined by callback or command and then
it gives you an example right in this

1324
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,520
it gives you an example right in this
 

1325
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,230
it gives you an example right in this
case this basically is like an event

1326
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,240
case this basically is like an event
 

1327
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,789
case this basically is like an event
listener if you don't know this is so

1328
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
listener if you don't know this is so
 

1329
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,190
listener if you don't know this is so
this says Hey listen to when we yank

1330
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200
this says Hey listen to when we yank
 

1331
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,350
this says Hey listen to when we yank
some text and what are we going to do

1332
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,360
some text and what are we going to do
 

1333
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,149
some text and what are we going to do
we've got a table now right so we see

1334
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:13,159
we've got a table now right so we see
 

1335
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:15,310
we've got a table now right so we see
our table and we say okay so our

1336
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:15,320
our table and we say okay so our
 

1337
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,110
our table and we say okay so our
description that's what the desk is is

1338
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
description that's what the desk is is
 

1339
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,149
description that's what the desk is is
this string right so this is later when

1340
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:19,159
this string right so this is later when
 

1341
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,789
this string right so this is later when
we check this we'll be able to see what

1342
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:20,799
we check this we'll be able to see what
 

1343
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,590
we check this we'll be able to see what
the description was it has a group right

1344
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
the description was it has a group right
 

1345
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,310
the description was it has a group right
and we can just read this again we say

1346
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:25,320
and we can just read this again we say
 

1347
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,669
and we can just read this again we say
okay we're using vim's API we're

1348
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:26,679
okay we're using vim's API we're
 

1349
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:28,630
okay we're using vim's API we're
starting to piece together okay Vim is

1350
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
starting to piece together okay Vim is
 

1351
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,310
starting to piece together okay Vim is
very useful andm create our group right

1352
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,320
very useful andm create our group right
 

1353
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,549
very useful andm create our group right
and then we're going to do something

1354
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
and then we're going to do something
 

1355
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,750
and then we're going to do something
like Kickstart highlight yank it's cuz I

1356
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:34,760
like Kickstart highlight yank it's cuz I
 

1357
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,230
like Kickstart highlight yank it's cuz I
yanked this code from kick start which I

1358
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,240
yanked this code from kick start which I
 

1359
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,350
yanked this code from kick start which I
think is pretty

1360
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:38,360
think is pretty
 

1361
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,310
think is pretty
cool and then we're going to clear all

1362
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
cool and then we're going to clear all
 

1363
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,950
cool and then we're going to clear all
the other ones you might not know

1364
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:41,960
the other ones you might not know
 

1365
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,830
the other ones you might not know
exactly what that does but you could go

1366
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:43,840
exactly what that does but you could go
 

1367
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,909
exactly what that does but you could go
ahead and check create out group here

1368
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
ahead and check create out group here
 

1369
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,029
ahead and check create out group here
and say create or get an autoc command

1370
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:48,039
and say create or get an autoc command
 

1371
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,710
and say create or get an autoc command
group or autoc command groups if you

1372
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:49,720
group or autoc command groups if you
 

1373
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,070
group or autoc command groups if you
remember from last time we can press or

1374
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,080
remember from last time we can press or
 

1375
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,110
remember from last time we can press or
shift K to go inside of here and read

1376
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,120
shift K to go inside of here and read
 

1377
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,549
shift K to go inside of here and read
about this not going to read too much

1378
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:55,559
about this not going to read too much
 

1379
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,950
about this not going to read too much
about this but you should basically

1380
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:56,960
about this but you should basically
 

1381
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,909
about this but you should basically
think of this as saying like hey okayy

1382
00:26:58,909 --> 00:26:58,919
think of this as saying like hey okayy
 

1383
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,430
think of this as saying like hey okayy
um I don't want to register this

1384
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:00,440
um I don't want to register this
 

1385
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,510
um I don't want to register this
multiple times okay so I'm going to make

1386
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
multiple times okay so I'm going to make
 

1387
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,549
multiple times okay so I'm going to make
sure that we clear all the old ones

1388
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:05,559
sure that we clear all the old ones
 

1389
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,669
sure that we clear all the old ones
before we make a new one and then hey

1390
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
before we make a new one and then hey
 

1391
