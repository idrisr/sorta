the initial project for
 

121
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,790
the initial project for
terao so then we are going to use terao

122
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:57,800
terao so then we are going to use terao
 

123
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,750

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,589
a folder structure which includes the
site name and the infrastructure project

326
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
site name and the infrastructure project
 

327
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,749
site name and the infrastructure project
name so here my site name is Cosmos and

328
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
name so here my site name is Cosmos and
 

329
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,550
name so here my site name is Cosmos and
uh inside that I'm going to create a

330
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:21,560
uh inside that I'm going to create a
 

331
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,270
uh inside that I'm going to create a
folder with the name

332
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,280

 

333
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,830

Jupiter okay so this folder is going to

334
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
Jupiter okay so this folder is going to
 

335
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,230
Jupiter okay so this folder is going to
manage all the

336
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,240
manage all the
 

337
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,589
manage all the
infrastructure within this

338
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:34,599
infrastructure within this
 

339
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,670
infrastructure within this
proxo okay so inside that we need a

340
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
proxo okay so inside that we need a
 

341
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,829
proxo okay so inside that we need a
main.tf file a providers. tfile

342
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:42,839
main.tf file a providers. tfile
 

343
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,070
main.tf file a providers. tfile
terraform dotf file

344
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
terraform dotf file
 

345
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,389
terraform dotf file
okay so in order to use terraform for

346
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:49,399
okay so in order to use terraform for
 

347
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,670
okay so in order to use terraform for
proxmox we need a proxmox provider so

348
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:52,680
proxmox we need a proxmox provider so
 

349
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,269
proxmox we need a proxmox provider so
let's prox

350
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279

 

351
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,949

mod Okay so so we actually have a couple

352
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
mod Okay so so we actually have a couple
 

353
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,030
mod Okay so so we actually have a couple
of different options and uh what I used

354
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,040
of different options and uh what I used
 

355
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,949
of different options and uh what I used
before is this one tmate box MOX

356
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:07,959
before is this one tmate box MOX
 

357
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,389
before is this one tmate box MOX
provider and here in resource you can

358
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
provider and here in resource you can
 

359
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,230
provider and here in resource you can
see it can create a prox MOX qm virtual

360
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
see it can create a prox MOX qm virtual
 

361
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,269
see it can create a prox MOX qm virtual
machines and lxc and also cloud in discs

362
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:18,279
machines and lxc and also cloud in discs
 

363
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,269
machines and lxc and also cloud in discs
so this looks like a good start for

364
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
so this looks like a good start for
 

365
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,470
so this looks like a good start for
us let's copy this actually before that

366
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
us let's copy this actually before that
 

367
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,230
us let's copy this actually before that
we need to use the provider

368
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,240
we need to use the provider
 

369
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,310
we need to use the provider
so we need to initi ize the ter from

370
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
so we need to initi ize the ter from
 

371
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,670
so we need to initi ize the ter from
Project by adding this

372
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:34,680

 

373
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,269

here okay so this is going to use

374
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:38,279
here okay so this is going to use
 

375
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,710
here okay so this is going to use
3.01

376
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
3.01
 

377
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,110
3.01
rc4 okay and uh

378
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
rc4 okay and uh
 

379
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,310
rc4 okay and uh
configuration we need to first check the

380
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:47,320
configuration we need to first check the
 

381
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,470
configuration we need to first check the
configuration

382
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480

 

383
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,389

part so first of all we need to create a

384
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:53,399
part so first of all we need to create a
 

385
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,710
part so first of all we need to create a
the new user name perform Prof and uh

386
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:57,720
the new user name perform Prof and uh
 

387
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,389
the new user name perform Prof and uh
assign the necessary permissions to be

388
00:09:59,389 --> 00:09:59,399
assign the necessary permissions to be
 

389
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,630
assign the necessary permissions to be
able to create the virtual machines and

390
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:01,640
able to create the virtual machines and
 

391
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,790
able to create the virtual machines and
then provide those credentials in here

392
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
then provide those credentials in here
 

393
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,550
then provide those credentials in here
to be able to connect to proxmox okay

394
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
to be able to connect to proxmox okay
 

395
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,269
to be able to connect to proxmox okay
let's do

396
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:10,279
let's do
 

397
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,870
let's do
this so this is going to create a new

398
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
this so this is going to create a new
 

399
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,829
this so this is going to create a new
role named tform Pro and uh let's have

400
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
role named tform Pro and uh let's have
 

401
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,389
role named tform Pro and uh let's have
quick look through the permissions to

402
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
quick look through the permissions to
 

403
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,269
quick look through the permissions to
see that it's

404
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:22,279

 

405
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,150

correct okay nothing crazy I think then

406
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
correct okay nothing crazy I think then
 

407
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,389
correct okay nothing crazy I think then
creates a user and uh here we had to

408
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
creates a user and uh here we had to
 

409
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,870
creates a user and uh here we had to
provide a password

410
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:29,880
provide a password
 

411
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,150
provide a password
okay then it assigns the role to this

412
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
okay then it assigns the role to this
 

413
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,550
okay then it assigns the role to this
user okay let's add the role

414
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560

 

415
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,470

first okay and then

416
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
first okay and then
 

417
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,269
first okay and then
user so I'm going to use a simple

418
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
user so I'm going to use a simple
 

419
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,069
user so I'm going to use a simple
password now and then change it

420
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079

 

421
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,310

later because I'll have to add it to my

422
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
later because I'll have to add it to my
 

423
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,990
later because I'll have to add it to my
bit

424
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
bit
 

425
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,110
bit
Wen and

426
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,120
Wen and
 

427
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,829
Wen and
then allow the user with this role okay

428
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:04,839
then allow the user with this role okay
 

429
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,150
then allow the user with this role okay
and then we need to create a connection

430
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,160
and then we need to create a connection
 

431
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,670
and then we need to create a connection
by username and

432
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:08,680
by username and
 

433
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:15,069
by username and
password

434
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:15,079

 

435
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,550

okay so in order to provide this

436
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:17,560
okay so in order to provide this
 

437
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,670
okay so in order to provide this
environment variables I'm going to use

438
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
environment variables I'm going to use
 

439
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,310
environment variables I'm going to use
uh D so I can add this

440
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320

 

441
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,350

here so what I'm going to do is

442
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:28,360
here so what I'm going to do is
 

443
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,629
here so what I'm going to do is
eventually

444
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:30,639
eventually
 

445
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,829
eventually
move this to a new password manager so

446
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
move this to a new password manager so
 

447
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,710
move this to a new password manager so
instead of exporting this instead of

448
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
instead of exporting this instead of
 

449
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,949
instead of exporting this instead of
hardcoding this here it is going to get

450
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
hardcoding this here it is going to get
 

451
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,670
hardcoding this here it is going to get
it from New pass okay so for that I'm

452
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:42,680
it from New pass okay so for that I'm
 

453
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,069
it from New pass okay so for that I'm
going to use this something called

454
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:47,079
going to use this something called
 

455
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,069
going to use this something called
D so what DM does is whenever we CD into

456
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:51,079
D so what DM does is whenever we CD into
 

457
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:53,990
D so what DM does is whenever we CD into
a directory and if it has a envc it's

458
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
a directory and if it has a envc it's
 

459
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,509
a directory and if it has a envc it's
going to Source it

460
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
going to Source it
 

461
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,550
going to Source it
automatically so we

462
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:57,560
automatically so we
 

463
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,590
automatically so we
can we can also add uh like scripts here

464
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
can we can also add uh like scripts here
 

465
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,949
can we can also add uh like scripts here
or things like

466
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
or things like
 

467
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,230
or things like
that so this makes our workflow much

468
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,240
that so this makes our workflow much
 

469
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,230
that so this makes our workflow much
easier so you don't have to run this

470
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:07,240
easier so you don't have to run this
 

471
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,790
easier so you don't have to run this
command each time when you have to run a

472
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
command each time when you have to run a
 

473
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,110
command each time when you have to run a
terraform

474
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,120
terraform
 

475
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,550
terraform
command Okay so let's uh let's try it

476
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560

 

477
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,069

out let's try from it oh sorry I'm in

478
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:21,079
out let's try from it oh sorry I'm in
 

479
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,870
out let's try from it oh sorry I'm in
the wrong folder of

480
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
the wrong folder of
 

481
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,949
the wrong folder of
course so as you see when we are new

482
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:25,959
course so as you see when we are new
 

483
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,870
course so as you see when we are new
nvrc file then D will complain that this

484
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
nvrc file then D will complain that this
 

485
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,590
nvrc file then D will complain that this
is not yet allowed so we have to allow

486
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
is not yet allowed so we have to allow
 

487
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,310
is not yet allowed so we have to allow
it whenever we change this for security

488
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
it whenever we change this for security
 

489
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,870
it whenever we change this for security
purposes so if I do

490
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
purposes so if I do
 

491
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,110
purposes so if I do
the allow okay so it's going to export

492
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,120
the allow okay so it's going to export
 

493
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,770
the allow okay so it's going to export
these two these two

494
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:46,780

496
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:50,519

 

497
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,150

variables let's do a simple terraform

498
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,160
variables let's do a simple terraform
 

499
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,550
variables let's do a simple terraform
plan and see what's happening okay there

500
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:55,560
plan and see what's happening okay there
 

501
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,710
plan and see what's happening okay there
are no changes because we haven't

502
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
are no changes because we haven't
 

503
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,069
are no changes because we haven't
defined any resources yet perfect and uh

504
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
defined any resources yet perfect and uh
 

505
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,069
defined any resources yet perfect and uh
what else do we

506
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
what else do we
 

507
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,189
what else do we
need okay I don't think we need anything

508
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:04,199
need okay I don't think we need anything
 

509
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,310
need okay I don't think we need anything
else so the provider is set up terraform

510
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,320
else so the provider is set up terraform
 

511
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,069
else so the provider is set up terraform
is ready now we can go

512
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079

 

513
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,949

to creating a q km

514
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:15,959
to creating a q km
 

515
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,069
to creating a q km
resource okay so this is how we Define a

516
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:19,079
resource okay so this is how we Define a
 

517
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,069
resource okay so this is how we Define a
virtual machine uh this it is called

518
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
virtual machine uh this it is called
 

519
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,269
virtual machine uh this it is called
proxmox VM Kimu then we can provide all

520
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:24,279
proxmox VM Kimu then we can provide all
 

521
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,509
proxmox VM Kimu then we can provide all
the parameters like the name of the

522
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:26,519
the parameters like the name of the
 

523
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,110
the parameters like the name of the
virtual machine which node it has to be

524
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
virtual machine which node it has to be
 

525
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,069
virtual machine which node it has to be
be deployed to and all the

526
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:31,079
be deployed to and all the
 

527
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,069
be deployed to and all the
additional uh discs CPU memory all those

528
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:35,079
additional uh discs CPU memory all those
 

529
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,949
additional uh discs CPU memory all those
details so this provider actually has a

530
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
details so this provider actually has a
 

531
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,350
details so this provider actually has a
lot of parameters to go through so

532
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:42,360
lot of parameters to go through so
 

533
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,470
lot of parameters to go through so
instead of defining this from scratch

534
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:45,480
instead of defining this from scratch
 

535
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,389
instead of defining this from scratch
the easiest approach which I usually

536
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:47,399
the easiest approach which I usually
 

537
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,550
the easiest approach which I usually
follow is to create one VM from here

538
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
follow is to create one VM from here
 

539
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,829
follow is to create one VM from here
from scratch and then import it to

540
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
from scratch and then import it to
 

541
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,030
from scratch and then import it to
terraform then we can start tweaking

542
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,040
terraform then we can start tweaking
 

543
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,870
terraform then we can start tweaking
this and uh use that as a template for

544
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
this and uh use that as a template for
 

545
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,350
this and uh use that as a template for
the

546
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:00,360
the
 

547
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,990
the
the next set of

548
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
the next set of
 

549
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,350
the next set of
images Okay so let's try that let's

550
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
images Okay so let's try that let's
 

551
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,990
images Okay so let's try that let's
create a VM and

552
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
create a VM and
 

553
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,749
create a VM and
sayit okay call it

554
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:11,759
sayit okay call it
 

555
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,710
sayit okay call it
nxo so here we are using the image which

556
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
nxo so here we are using the image which
 

557
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,710
nxo so here we are using the image which
we just

558
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:15,720
we just
 

559
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,269
we just
downloaded so let's leave everything as

560
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:18,279
downloaded so let's leave everything as
 

561
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,310
downloaded so let's leave everything as
default and yeah let's add a chem agent

562
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:21,320
default and yeah let's add a chem agent
 

563
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,840

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
well okay diss we will give it let's say
 

569
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,550
well okay diss we will give it let's say
50 g B and under the local

570
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
50 g B and under the local
 

571
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,389
50 g B and under the local
lbm okay this will

572
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
lbm okay this will
 

573
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,389
lbm okay this will
be okay CPU let's keep it say two

574
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
be okay CPU let's keep it say two
 

575
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,790
be okay CPU let's keep it say two
cores and uh 2 G be Memory looks good

576
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
cores and uh 2 G be Memory looks good
 

577
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,990
cores and uh 2 G be Memory looks good
Network give it a VI

578
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,000
Network give it a VI
 

579
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,910
Network give it a VI

00:14:58,749 --> 00:14:58,759
okay right two cores 2GB name is nio
 

583
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,110
okay right two cores 2GB name is nio
looks good to

584
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,120
looks good to
 

585
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,749
looks good to
me so the virtual machine is created now

586
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:03,759
me so the virtual machine is created now
 

587
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,949
me so the virtual machine is created now
here what we can do is if you scroll

588
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:05,959
here what we can do is if you scroll
 

589
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,790
here what we can do is if you scroll
down there should be an option called

590
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:07,800
down there should be an option called
 

591
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,069
down there should be an option called
import so terraform has a way

592
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:11,079
import so terraform has a way
 

593
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,990
import so terraform has a way
to import an existing resource into the

594
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
to import an existing resource into the
 

595
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,030
to import an existing resource into the
code instead of writing this from

596
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,040
code instead of writing this from
 

597
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,790
code instead of writing this from
scratch so let's do

598
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800

 

599
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:32,389

that so

600
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399

 

601
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,590

import blocks okay so let's use this

602
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
import blocks okay so let's use this
 

603
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,309
import blocks okay so let's use this
syntax to import this existing virtual

604
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:37,319
syntax to import this existing virtual
 

605
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,269
syntax to import this existing virtual
machine into our code so the reason why

606
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:40,279
machine into our code so the reason why
 

607
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,269
machine into our code so the reason why
we using this instead of the import

608
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:42,279
we using this instead of the import
 

609
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,110
we using this instead of the import
command is we can also do code

610
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,120
command is we can also do code
 

611
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,710
command is we can also do code
generation with this so it will generate

612
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
generation with this so it will generate
 

613
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,949
generation with this so it will generate
the entire configuration for

614
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
the entire configuration for
 

615
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,790
the entire configuration for
us

616
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
us
 

617
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,030
us
imports.

618
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,040

 

619
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,309

DF so this will be

620
00:15:59,309 --> 00:15:59,319

625
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,150

okay dot

626
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160

 

627
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,230

nyos and the ID is the VM ID which

628
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
nyos and the ID is the VM ID which
 

629
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,749
nyos and the ID is the VM ID which
is

630
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:16,759
is

100
 

633
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,870
100
okay now what we can do is when we do

634
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:23,880
okay now what we can do is when we do
 

635
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,990
okay now what we can do is when we do
terraform plan it should show that

636
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
terraform plan it should show that
 

637
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,749
terraform plan it should show that
configuration for about Target does not

638
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
configuration for about Target does not
 

639
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,910
configuration for about Target does not
exist because we don't have the code for

640
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
exist because we don't have the code for
 

641
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,389
exist because we don't have the code for
this so we can do terraform plan with

642
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:35,399
this so we can do terraform plan with
 

643
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,670
this so we can do terraform plan with
generate config out so this parameter is

644
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
generate config out so this parameter is
 

645
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,670
generate config out so this parameter is
going so with this parameter we can

646
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
going so with this parameter we can
 

647
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,629
going so with this parameter we can
Define that uh it should try to generate

648
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
Define that uh it should try to generate
 

649
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,069
Define that uh it should try to generate
the configuration as code for this

650
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:47,079
the configuration as code for this
 

651
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:49,829
the configuration as code for this
resource and uh write it to generator.

652
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
resource and uh write it to generator.
 

653
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,910
resource and uh write it to generator.
TF let's try that and it doesn't

654
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920

 

655
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,069

work because you must specify an

656
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
work because you must specify an
 

657
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,870
work because you must specify an
endpoint for the prop most envirment

658
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880

 

659
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,069

okay so it looks like we need ah of

660
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
okay so it looks like we need ah of
 

661
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,870
okay so it looks like we need ah of
course of

662
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:07,880
course of
 

663
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:16,029
course of
course PM

664
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:16,039

 

665
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:25,110

P so this is going to be this

666
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120

 

667
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:32,510

URL okay sorry

668
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:32,520

 

669
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,230

okay let's let's try

670
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240

 

671
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,750

again next trying to read and pass the

672
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:40,760
again next trying to read and pass the
 

673
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,350
again next trying to read and pass the
resource in valid resource format it

674
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:42,360
resource in valid resource format it
 

675
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,870
resource in valid resource format it
should be node type VM ID what is the

676
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880

 

677
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,270

type so node is

678
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,280
type so node is
 

679
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,590
type so node is
Jupiter and I think it's

680
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
Jupiter and I think it's
 

681
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,430
Jupiter and I think it's
K okay so now that we specify the the ID

682
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
K okay so now that we specify the the ID
 

683
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,230
K okay so now that we specify the the ID
of the virtual machine to import let's

684
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
of the virtual machine to import let's
 

685
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,950
of the virtual machine to import let's
try

686
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:09,960

 

687
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,110

the okay so it's not always perfect

688
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
the okay so it's not always perfect
 

689
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,110
the okay so it's not always perfect
sometimes there can be

690
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
sometimes there can be
 

691
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,029
sometimes there can be
conflict so I think we can just get rid

692
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:18,039
conflict so I think we can just get rid
 

693
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,909
conflict so I think we can just get rid
of the this parameter to make it

694
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:20,919
of the this parameter to make it
 

695
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,430
of the this parameter to make it
work so generator TF as you can see it

696
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:24,440
work so generator TF as you can see it
 

697
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,510
work so generator TF as you can see it
has already generated the entire

698
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:26,520
has already generated the entire
 

699
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,149
has already generated the entire
configuration for us

700
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:30,159
configuration for us
 

701
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,430
configuration for us
so here it was complaining about line

702
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:32,440
so here it was complaining about line
 

703
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,710
so here it was complaining about line
number

704
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:33,720
number
 

705
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,789
number
77 let's

706
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799

 

707
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,470

see see don't pass

708
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:41,480
see see don't pass
 

709
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,909
see see don't pass
through let's remove this part and leave

710
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:44,919
through let's remove this part and leave
 

711
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,390
through let's remove this part and leave
it as

712
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
it as
 

713
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,750
it as
default

714
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760

 

715
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,149

then can we do a plan now so here as you

716
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:57,159
then can we do a plan now so here as you
 

717
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,830
then can we do a plan now so here as you
can see now it is trying to import this

718
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:58,840
can see now it is trying to import this
 

719
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,270
can see now it is trying to import this
into our state and

720
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,280
into our state and
 

721
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,190
into our state and
uh looks

722
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,200
uh looks
 

723
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:12,870
uh looks
good we can apply this

724
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880

 

725
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,669

now perfect so now we should have a new

726
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
now perfect so now we should have a new
 

727
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,029
now perfect so now we should have a new
state

728
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
state
 

729
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,230
state
file so it has created a ter TF typ file

730
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,240
file so it has created a ter TF typ file
 

731
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,549
file so it has created a ter TF typ file
this will contain the entire state of

732
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:23,559
this will contain the entire state of
 

733
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,950
this will contain the entire state of
our infrastructure so we not pushing

734
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
our infrastructure so we not pushing
 

735
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,750
our infrastructure so we not pushing
this to get at the moment but if

736
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:28,760
this to get at the moment but if
 

737
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,070
this to get at the moment but if
eventually we will encrypt this and push

738
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,080
eventually we will encrypt this and push
 

739
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,350
eventually we will encrypt this and push
it to Kit you can also use like a S3 or

740
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:34,360
it to Kit you can also use like a S3 or
 

741
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,669
it to Kit you can also use like a S3 or
some other cloud storage for storing the

742
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:38,679
some other cloud storage for storing the
 

743
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,590
some other cloud storage for storing the
state but I prefer to just keep it

744
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:40,600
state but I prefer to just keep it
 

745
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,310
state but I prefer to just keep it
simple and uh push it as encrypted into

746
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320
simple and uh push it as encrypted into
 

747
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,350
simple and uh push it as encrypted into
git okay so this is generated. TF I will

748
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
git okay so this is generated. TF I will
 

749
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,470
git okay so this is generated. TF I will
just REM rename it to

750
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:51,480
just REM rename it to
 

751
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,590
just REM rename it to
n.f okay so let's clean up a

752
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
n.f okay so let's clean up a
 

753
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,830
n.f okay so let's clean up a
bit remove that part and uh all the

754
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,840
bit remove that part and uh all the
 

755
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,110
bit remove that part and uh all the
parameters are optional so we can

756
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
parameters are optional so we can
 

757
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:09,310
parameters are optional so we can
actually do a find and

758
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,320

 

759
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,950

replace okay so that removed

760
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
replace okay so that removed
 

761
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,190
replace okay so that removed
everything so these are the only

762
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:16,200
everything so these are the only
 

763
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,789
everything so these are the only
parameters which we care

764
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
parameters which we care
 

765
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,390
parameters which we care
about

766
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,400

 

767
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,350

okay all right looking good so we can

768
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,360
okay all right looking good so we can
 

769
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,310
okay all right looking good so we can
actually try one thing so we can try to

770
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
actually try one thing so we can try to
 

771
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,190
actually try one thing so we can try to
duplicate this and try to create a new

772
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,200
duplicate this and try to create a new
 

773
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,830
duplicate this and try to create a new
VM without touching the UI so I'm going

774
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840
VM without touching the UI so I'm going
 

775
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,149
VM without touching the UI so I'm going
to add a nios 2.

776
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:37,159
to add a nios 2.
 

777
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,870
to add a nios 2.
DF and then use this as a

778
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880

 

779
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,149

template so this will be nxo

780
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
template so this will be nxo
 

781
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,830
template so this will be nxo
2 and um we need to adjust the name to

782
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:50,840
2 and um we need to adjust the name to
 

783
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,870
2 and um we need to adjust the name to
make it

784
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:51,880
make it
 

785
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,190
make it
unique then we need to adjust the VM ID

786
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
unique then we need to adjust the VM ID
 

787
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,750
unique then we need to adjust the VM ID
not sure if it's a parameter here no I

788
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
not sure if it's a parameter here no I
 

789
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,310
not sure if it's a parameter here no I
can add a VM ID

790
00:20:59,310 --> 00:20:59,320
can add a VM ID
 

791
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,870
can add a VM ID
= to

792
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
= to
 

793
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,190
= to
1.2 so the previous one was 100 I think

794
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
1.2 so the previous one was 100 I think
 

795
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,870
1.2 so the previous one was 100 I think
yep so let's make it 1

796
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
yep so let's make it 1
 

797
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,909
yep so let's make it 1
not2 then it will use the same ISO it

798
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
not2 then it will use the same ISO it
 

799
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,830
not2 then it will use the same ISO it
will add a disk maybe let's keep the dis

800
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:12,840
will add a disk maybe let's keep the dis
 

801
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,950
will add a disk maybe let's keep the dis
to 20

802
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
to 20

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,269
to 20
GB we are testing

804
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:17,279
GB we are testing
 

805
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,669
GB we are testing
anyway I think I probably added this

806
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
anyway I think I probably added this
 

807
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,230
anyway I think I probably added this
okay Network keep it

808
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:27,240
okay Network keep it
 

809
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,549
okay Network keep it
same and

810
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:29,559
same and
 

811
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,950
same and
uh I guess I'm not supposed to provide

812
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:33,960
uh I guess I'm not supposed to provide
 

813
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,470
uh I guess I'm not supposed to provide
this you know what I will just leave

details probably we only need the bridge

818
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:44,200
details probably we only need the bridge
 

819
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,390
details probably we only need the bridge
and the

820
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400

 

821
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,830

right let's
 

825
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,950
right let's
see terraform

826
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
see terraform
 

827
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,350
see terraform
plan Okay so this will create a new

828
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,360
plan Okay so this will create a new
 

829
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,230
plan Okay so this will create a new
virtual

830
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
machine with the name nio
 

833
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,470
machine with the name nio
2 name is here okay same memory same

834
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
2 name is here okay same memory same
 

835
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,110
2 name is here okay same memory same
same CPUs all

836
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,120

 

837
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,230

good okay
 

839
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,190
good okay
apply and use Target node or agent

840
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,200
apply and use Target node or agent
 

841
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:40,750
apply and use Target node or agent
nodes did we missed that agent

842
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:40,760

 

843
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,070

H I'm going to do a Terra

844
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
H I'm going to do a Terra
 

845
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,750
H I'm going to do a Terra
form fmt to format the code then we can

846
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:48,760
form fmt to format the code then we can
 

847
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,350
form fmt to format the code then we can
apply

848
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360

 

849
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,549

again it's creating that's good news

850
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
again it's creating that's good news
 

851
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,470
again it's creating that's good news
let's look at the UI

852
00:22:59,470 --> 00:22:59,480
let's look at the UI
 

853
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,470
let's look at the UI
okay as you can see now the O has

854
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:03,480
okay as you can see now the O has
 

855
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,669
okay as you can see now the O has
started it's not started yet okay so it

856
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:06,679
started it's not started yet okay so it
 

857
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,269
started it's not started yet okay so it
has created the virtual machine with the

858
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:09,279
has created the virtual machine with the
 

859
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,310
has created the virtual machine with the
exact same

860
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
exact same
 

861
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,029
exact same
settings you can see memory processors

862
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
settings you can see memory processors
 

863
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,990
settings you can see memory processors
all good and it is using the CD ROM as

864
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
all good and it is using the CD ROM as
 

865
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,149
all good and it is using the CD ROM as
well and the hard disk is also

866
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
well and the hard disk is also
 

867
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,070
well and the hard disk is also
here so

868
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,080

 

869
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,909

now let's also keep it started how do we

870
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:26,919
now let's also keep it started how do we
 

871
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,470
now let's also keep it started how do we
start this

872
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480

 

873
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,230

okay if he set the on boot to true then

874
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
okay if he set the on boot to true then
 

875
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,990
okay if he set the on boot to true then
it will start at the time of boot let's

876
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,000
it will start at the time of boot let's
 

877
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,990
it will start at the time of boot let's
do that is it true okay it's already

878
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,000

 

879
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,390

true VM State should be

880
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
true VM State should be
 

881
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,029
true VM State should be
running

882
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:46,039
running
 

883
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,029
running
okay BM state is now stopped so let's

884
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
okay BM state is now stopped so let's
 

885
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,190
okay BM state is now stopped so let's
keep

886
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:50,200
keep
 

887
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,789
keep
it change it to running so we are going

888
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:53,799
it change it to running so we are going
 

889
00:23:53,799 --> 00:24:00,549
it change it to running so we are going
to start both the instances

890
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559

 

891
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,950

apply okay so you can see that uh it's
 

895
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,909
apply okay so you can see that uh it's
now changing the Status to running so

896
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:08,919
now changing the Status to running so
 

897
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,149
now changing the Status to running so
this is going to start both the virual

898
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:13,159

 

899
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:16,390

machines okay it is started so let's

900
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
machines okay it is started so let's
 

901
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,830
machines okay it is started so let's
check the

902
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
check the
 

903
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,390
check the
console so this time let's go let's

904
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:21,400
console so this time let's go let's
 

905
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:34,430
console so this time let's go let's
start it

906
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,440

 

907
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,990

perfect let's check

908
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
perfect let's check
 

909
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,710
perfect let's check
the so here you can see that we have the

910
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
the so here you can see that we have the
 

911
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,470
the so here you can see that we have the
20 GB disc attached and also the

912
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:43,480
20 GB disc attached and also the
 

913
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,029
20 GB disc attached and also the
iso so once we install

914
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
iso so once we install
 

915
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,149
iso so once we install
the once we install the Nyx o into this

916
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
the once we install the Nyx o into this
 

917
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,350
the once we install the Nyx o into this
disk we can get rid of the iso

918
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360
disk we can get rid of the iso
 

919
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,830
disk we can get rid of the iso
well let's go back to a checklist so we

920
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:56,840
well let's go back to a checklist so we
 

921
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,510
well let's go back to a checklist so we
have the terraform set up and we Alo got

922
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
have the terraform set up and we Alo got
 

923
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,510
have the terraform set up and we Alo got
the nxo watching machine

924
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
the nxo watching machine
 

925
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,310
the nxo watching machine
running so that's it for this video in

926
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
running so that's it for this video in
 

927
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,389
running so that's it for this video in
the next video we will optimize it and

928
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:07,399
the next video we will optimize it and
 

929
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:09,669
the next video we will optimize it and
start setting up our game server using

930
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
start setting up our game server using
 

931
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,000
start setting up our game server using
NYX o
